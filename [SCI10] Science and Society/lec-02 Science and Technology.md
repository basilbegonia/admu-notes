# What Makes It Science?

* **Roots of Science**
  * **Paradigm**: An interpretation of the physical world to which scientists subscribe
    * The world is the way it is, but the paradigm dictates how we interpret the world
  * **Thales (ca. 585 BC)**: Idea of natural phenomena as something that can be explained by laws rather than the arbitrary acts of gods
    * Greek Ideal of Science: Systematic (Coherent), Certain, Universal
    * Your senses can fool you, use reason instead
  * **Plato (427-347 BC)**: Observation has little to do with true knowledge. Only "ideas" or contents of the mind are real.
    * eg. A real circle only exists in the mind
  * **Aristotle (384-322 BC)**: Sensible things are also real but inferior to ideas. They are particular manifestations of universal truths.
    * Observations: for discovery
    * The Mind: For validating or proving 
* **Transition in Methods**: From RATIONAL+Empirical: Greeks to Copernicus [Heliocentric Theory]: Conceptualism is Strong) to RATIONAL+EMPIRICAL (Newton)
* **Transition in Goals**: Complete Certainty to Probability a little short of certainty
  * There will always be the possibility of a counter example ï¼ˆeg. only need one black swan to prove not all swans are naturally white)
* **Characteristics of a Scientific Proposition**
  * Repeatability: Ensure scientists can redo your experiment to 
  * Falsifiability (*Karl Popper*): You can design an experiment in which getting a result makes the claim false. If the experiment cannot be tested, it is not scientific.
* **Science is not certainty**: The absolute certainty of dogmas is anathema (contrary) to science
  * Science is no longer synonymous to static, unchanging theses.
* **Hierarchy of Statements**
  * **Direct Observation**
  * **Natural/Empirical Laws**: Putting observations together and seeing if a pattern can be observed using equations (eg. Newton's Laws)
  * **Scientific Theory**: A result of many laws coming together (eg. Theory of Evolution)
    * Natural language use: Guess, Speculation
    * In science: Backed up by laws and evidence, backed up by a cohesive body
  * **Overarching Fundamental Principles** (eg. Conservation of Mass and Energy)
