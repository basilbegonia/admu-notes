# What Makes It Science?

* **What is Science?**
  * A **rational** inquiry into **nature** to understand what is happening around us
    * Scientific Method: Logical Structure/ Rational
    * Nature: Object of the inquiry
  * Two assumptions:
    * There is regularity in nature
    * The human mind can "know": We are capable of finding, knowing and understanding the regularity in nature
* **What is Technology?**
  * Human application of knowledge into the making of tools and the use of natural resources
    * Knowledge: Non-material (Values, attitudes, beliefs, ideology)
    * Tools: High and Low tech material - apparatus, activities and organizational networks
  * Science is knowing *why*, while technology is knowing *how*
  * **Scientific Paradigm**: Tells us how to orient ourselves and what to look for
* **Kuhn Cycle**: Revolutionary, as science is dynamic
  * Normal Science: Most scientists agreed on science
  * Model Drift: As a result of anomalies
  * Model Crisis: The paradigm can no longer support the anomalies
  * Model Revolution
  * Shift in Paradigm: 
    * The old understanding is left behind, and a new concept is generated
    * Occurs when certain anomalies cannot be explained by the prevailing paradigm. The crisis brings about a change in world view.
    * eg. Geocentric Model, Transition from Ptolemaic to Copernican cosmology (The earth revolves around the sun)

* **The Scientific Method, Objectivity and Creativity in Science**
  * The practice of science is a *continuous process* of making observations, making sense of hte observations, and testing/verifying that understanding.
  * Science is experimental
    * Discover new phenomena and relationships
    * Verify laws, confirm theories/models and their predictions
  * **The Scientific Method**
    * The *well-posed problem*: A problem that can be stated with enough clarity and definiteness that it is guaranteed a solution
    * Ask a question, Do Background Research, Construct Hypothesis, Test with an Experiment, Analyze Results/ Draw Conclusion, Report Results
    * **What do we communicate in Science?**: As a Scientist, it is your obligation to report results in a journal, book or a conference
    * The Scientific Method: A "Comic Distortion"
    * **Pros**
      * Provides a systematic approach/guiding framework under the current paradigm
      * Allows for repeatability
      * Stresses rigor, honesty and integrity
    * **Cons**
      * Often not as straightforward as described
      * No guarantee of a breakthrough
      * Does not explicitly account for serendipity, insight or creativity
    * Science requires honesty and integrity
      * **Controversial Frauds**
        * **Dr. Hwang Woo-Suk**
          * Announced he cloned a cow, and successful human somatic cell cloning in two papers published in Science
          * Investigation by SNU found him guilty of scientific fraud (data fabrication)
        * **Glaciergate Scandal**
          * The IPCC benchmark report claimed that the glaciers in the Himalayas could vanish by 2035.
          * It turned out to be wrong (based only on a popular science news) and has seriously damaged the credibility of the IPCC report
        * **The Missing Link Fraud**
          * The National Geographic declared American paleontologists discovered the missing link: Feathered Dinosaurs
          * The paper was previously rejected by peer reviewed journals as it was a sensational fraud.
        * **Waksman-Schatz Controversy**
          * Dr. Selman Waksman was a professor of soil microbiology, was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of *streptomycin*
          * The discovery was done by his PhD student Albert Schatz
          * Evidence of Discovery: The two peer-reviewed papers and dissertation of Schatz
        * **Mark Hauser Fraud**
          * Marc Hauser was a professor of psychology, a leader in the field of animal and human cognition
          * He became famous for his findings that monkeys can draw correct conclusions about novel situations
          * He was found guilty of scientific misconduct (data fabrication) in 3 important peer-reviewed publications
      * **Scientific Retraction**: Withdrawing a published paper
        * Most common cause: Scientific Misconduct
        * A retraction is very damaging to the researcher's and institution's reputation
        * Fraudulent or faulty research can be retracted by the authors or by the journal concerned
      * **Science is unforgiving to the dishonest**
        * The bastions of good science can be duped by an *ethically impaired scientist*
        * The *pressure to publish* can motivate even the most brilliant researchers to plagiarize, fudge data and play loose with their methods.
        * Plagiarising leads to *retraction* and *banishment from the science community*.
    * **Objectivity in Science** 
      * Hypotheses and theories are objectively tested against experiments
      * Such an objective procedure would seem little room for personal prejudice
      * Individual scientists are not emotionally detached from their research. Rather, the scientific method draws its strength from the community of scientists
      * It is through this collective activity that objectivity emerges
  * **Science is a deeply social activity**: Conferences, Workshops, Peer Review, Professional Organizations
    * Getting networks of your peers, sharing your ideas/research findings with others
  * **Creativity in Science (Serendipity)**: Science is a creative endeavor; it is not merely a collection of facts
    * **Examples of Eureka Moments in Science**
      * **Percy LeBaron Spencer**: Discovered the microwave oven while
      * **Archimedes**: Discovered buoyancy, displacement
      * **Friedrich **: Discovered C6H6 (Organic Chemistry)
      * **Charles**: Rubber Melts (?)
      * **Alexander Flemming**: Discovered Penicillin
  * **The Limits of Science**: Cannot deal with morality or the existence of God
