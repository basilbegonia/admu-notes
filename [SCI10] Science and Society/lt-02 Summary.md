## Telecommunications in the 21st Century
* **Telecommunications**: Long distance communication
* **Three Trends of Technology**
  * Moved towards Digital Information
    * Ease of recording, reproduction and transmission
  * Communication is done through Wireless Technologies
    * From Wires to Fiberoptics
  * Building devices at Smaller Scales
    * Moore's Law, Nanotechnology
* **Philippine Telecommunications**
  * **1930-1940**: Telegraph and Radio Communication
    * Globe Wireless Limited (GWL), Mackay Radio and Telegraph (MRT), Philippine Press Wireless Inc (PREWI), Clavecilla Radio Systems (CRS)
  * **1940-1960**: Telegram
    * Radio Communications of the PH, Inc (RCPI), Philippine Telegraph&Telephone Co (PT&T)
    * Central office with a high-speed link would collect messages from different branches and relay these to a specific destination.
  * **1960-1990**: Telephone Networks
    * It was difficult to acquire a landline because of the infrastructure required for telephone networks.
    * PLDT adopted the [non-private] party line or multi-line system with distinct ringing sounds. 
      * Either subscriber can eavesdrop after the calls have been set up
      * Either subscriber can monopolize the line by using the phone continuously or leaving it off the cradle
    * **RA3436**: PLDT was granted a franchise to install, operate and maintain a telephone system (Nov 28 1928-1978)
    * **PD1978**: 1% Government Tax on PLDT
    * **RA6146 (1970)**: Replace party line services with main line services
* **Advances in Electricity and Magnetism**
  * Purpose of Telecommunications: Transmit and receive information from one geographical location to another
  * **Optical Telegraph**
    * Early telecommunication
    * Semaphore Telegraph: Used hand-like devices on a tower to transmit messages with different angles of "hands"
  * **Electrical Telegraph**
    * Converted information to electrical form
    * Telegraph Key: Depressed by an operator to complete an electrical circuit
    * Morse Telegraph: Dashes and Dots, was placed across the Atlantic Ocean (NA to EU)
  * **Alexander Grahambell**:
    * Two ideas: System that could send multiple messages simultaneously, and a device that transmitted speech electrically
    * Filed a patent for an electric telephone device (vs. **Elisha Gray**) and created the telephone with **Thomas Watson**
    * The Bell Telephone Company => Lucent Technologies
    * **Transmitter**: Microphone, converts the sound of caller's voice into electrical signals
    * **Receiver**: Handset, converts electrical signals back to sound waves
* **Digital Age: 0s and 1s Rule**
  * **Analog**
    * Information in terms of physical parameters where values change over a continuous range (eg. Sound, Thermometer, Analog Clocks)
    * Wave pattern of the original sound is patterned onto the electrical signal
    * Amplitude, Wavelength (s/f), Period (1/Frequency)
  * **Digital Age**
    * Binary method to represent numbers (bits)
    * **ASCII**: American Standard Code for Information Exchange
    * **Block Information**: Files with text or graphical information (eg. Data files, documents, pictures)
    * **Stream Information**: Series of images and frames (eg. Audio and Video files)
    * **Resolution**: How often you sample a signal
      * Sampling the signal: Checking the value at certain intervals
      * Converting from analog to digital: Check times more often
      * Low Res vs High Res: Storage Space, Computing Power
    * **Nyquist Criterion**: 
      * To get a good representation of your analog signal, you have to sample faster than the highest frequency content of the signal
      * Frequency (Hz): number of vibrations in a second 
    * **Advantages**
      * Mixing of various media in a single environment (eg. Multimedia Capable Phones)
      * Tolerance of digital information to noise (Electro Magnetic Interference)
      * Prices of digital circuits have dropped down considerably due to large&very large scale IC's compared to analog circuits
    * **Disadvantages**
      * Conversion from analog to digital may not be exact (needs more sampling to store resources)
      * Requires more time to submit (due to space and nature)
      * Solved with **compression methods**
* **Wireless Communication**
  * **Wires**: Oldest material for transition
    * Expensive, bulky and heavy
    * Susceptible to corrosion, noise and voltage sparks
  * **Fiber Optics**: Fibers that transmit light (continuously reflected)
    * Thin and light, carry signals for long distances without large diminution
    * Large Bandwidth
  * **Radio Waves**: 
    * Amplitude modulation (AM: News) vs Frequency modulation (FM: Music)
    * AM: High amplitude=1, Low amplitude=0
    * FM: High frequency is 0, Low frequency is 1
    * **RA7925 Section 4C**: Radio frequency spectrum is a public resource, and the government has to allocate the electromagnetic spectrum to these broadcasters
* **Communication over Networks**
  * Switching/Routing Calls: telephone switchboard operators => dial switchboards => electronic switching devices => computers
  * Networks: Make long distance communication more efficient because resources are better shared
* **Narrow Band: Time Domain Multiple Access (TDMA)**
* **Wide Band or Spread Spectrum: Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)**
* **Cellular Phone Networks**
* **The Internet**
* **Mobile, Personal and Multifaceted**
* **How have these trends in telecommunications affected our lifestyles and values?**
  * In the telegraph era, sending a message could not be done so from houses. You had to go to a community telegraph system
  * From communal to personal
  * Exposure to a larger community: Has been used to help combat things like culture shock
  * The Internet and Globalization: Economy and business transactions are easier on a global scale

## Have your cake and eat it, too
* **Why We Eat**
  * "You eat or you die"
  * Eating adaptations in humans: Movable jaw, teeth, bacteria in our gut
  * Homo Erectus (female) consumes about 2500 cals/day, but ate for 6 hours/day
    * Less in modern times due to processing and cooking: detoxification, more digestible
* **Food Consumption and Filipino Households**
  * Rice, Fish and Vegetables
  * Sangkap Pinoy Seal: Only 16% know what it's for
  * Most consumed fortified food (for children, pregnant and lactating women): Noodles and Sardines
  * 3/10 Fil children are stunted, 2/10 are underweight: Social classes => Less access for 5th Q
* **Unhealthy Diets**
  * Large waistlines are more vulnerable to heart and vascular diseases, ailments, etc
  * **Parts of a poor diet:**
    * Energy Dense and Nutrient Poor Foods
    * High in Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Salt and Refined Carbs (Passive Overconsumption)
    * Low consumption of fruits and vegetables (fiber)
  * We ironically eat food that doesn't help the "or you die" case
  * Reasons for eating other than survival: social situations, fun, comfort, as an art
    * eg. Pahiyas Festival, Gary Alan Fine
    * Gary Fine/Warren Belasco: Connection between identity and consumption gives food a central role in the creation of community, and we use our diet to convey images of public identity.
* **How have diets changed over the years?**
  * Telecommunication Advances: Access to international cuisines and broadening of perspectives
  * More processed foods: Busy lives, no time to cook (eg. Fast food, microwaveable dishes)
  * Lack of knowledge of food supply chain: Due to Globalization, we can get produce from international sources
    * Simple: "I grow, I eat"
    * Linear: Surplus, agricultural economies
    * Multifactiorial: Many growers producing different things
    * National: Expanding infrastructures and production diversity
    * International/Global: Increased GDP, trade agreements, advanced infrastructure for imports/exports
  * We focuse more on market prices than supply chain
* **Food Security**
  * Exists when all people at all times have
  * **Physical and economic access** to: Actually there and affordable
  * **Sufficient, safe and nutritious food**: Adequate supply and of good quality
  * To meet their **dietary needs and food preferences**: Food as a need and a culture
  * for an active and healthy life

## Building blocks, stumbling blocks
* **Biotechnology**
  * Technology that *utilizes living organisms to build our products*
  * Use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof"
  * eg. Domestication, Fermentation, Traditional Medicines, Selective/Cross Breeding, Genetic Engineering
* **Genetic Engineering**
  * Prior to GE, improvinga species involved sexual reproduction and breeding species with likeable traits (eg. Cabbages susceptible to fungus and drought)
    * Transgene (Desired Traits) being bred into another organism
    * eg. Gregor Mendel's Peas
  * Achieved through **Recombinant DNA Technology**
    * Consider bacteria with a **plasmid** (self-replicating DNA), use it in a **vector**, combine with other gene to make a **chimera**, and inject into a new organism
  * **Notable Examples**
    * **Flavr Savr**: Tomatoes that last longer, from changing the enzyme that caused them to rot (Last longer in shipments)
    * **Transgenic Squash**: Resists viruses, outproduces other squash that grow in the wild (Less Loss)
    * **Golden Rice**: Has Vitamin A from daffodil and soil bacteria (meant to address Vitamin A deficiency)
    * **Bt Corn**: Repels a pest (Corn Borer, Bacillus Thuringiensis) using bacterium from the soil
* **Issues**
  * Genes from another species can bring **Unanticipated Effects** (eg. transferring traits other than the one desired)
    * eg. Might contain bacterium toxins to insects we don't want to eliminate (eg. Monarch Butterfly, Caddisfly)
  * **Ethical, Religion and Choice Considerations**
    * eg. Islamic Jurisprudence Council (IJC): Biotech derived foods are halal, but only haram if they contain DNA from forbidden foods
  * **Who owns GMO's?**
    * Patents, **Genetic Use Restriction Technology**
    * eg. Farmer using seeds for second harvest: how do they get profits?
    * **Terminator Seeds**: Seeds that make the next generation sterile
    * Makes sense for profits, but rather selfish and unethical leading to protests
* **Problems with GMO's in PH Markets**
  * No standardised **labeling system**: Consumers need to be informed of what they're consuming
  * Proper education of consumers and law makers: Inform them of the positive effects of GE and Biotechnology
  * Transparency of Companies: Confront issues and inform the public properly
* **Is Genetic Engineering the answer to food security in developing countries?**
