# Technology and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

## Recap
* Science is dynamic
* Scientific Method
  * Emphasis on Experiments (Empirical)
  * Should be repeatable [Peer Review Process]
  * Falsifiable or Testable Statements
* Technology
  * Strongly correlated with national development
  * Issue on disasters and how they set us back
    * We are stuck in a rut, but technology can help us out of it through proper education, training and infrastructure to carry on and develop technology

## IPR as an issue related to S&T
* **Intellectual Property Rights**
* Ease of Reproduction
* Ease of Storage
* Ease of Dissemination
* How do we protect the authors and inventors?
  * **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)**: Rights granted to an author or inventor for exclusive right over the use of his/her creation for a certain period of time
    * **Copyrights**: Rights given to creators of original literary, scientific and artistic works
      * **Plagiarism**: Uncredited use of someone else's words or ideas
        * Unquestionable: Buying ,stealing, borrowing a paper, etc..
        * Grey Area: Close paraphrasing, building up on someone's ideas
        * Moral: Just Cite
    * **Trademarks**: Words, phrase, symbol or design that identifies and distinguishes a product from another
    * **Patents**: Rights over the manufacture, use and marketing of inventions
      * Product or Process?
      * Designed to prevent problems:
        * Free riding problem
        * Secrecy Problem
      * Inventor is given monopoly/compensation
      * Details are disclosed: Efficiency
      * Patents can also cover ideas, designs and plans that have never been produced
* **International Agreements**
  * 1994 TRIPs: Trade-related aspects of IPR
  * 2001 Doha Declaration: Amendments on interpretations of TRIPs provisions
* Issue: Napster

## Discontent with IPR Rules
* Protection for products, processes or both?
* Hindering tech transfer to IP-poor least developing countries
  * Patent Trolling: Company attempts to enforce patents against accused infringers (Apple vs Samsung)
  * Lack of competencies in LDC's for effective transfer
  * Reluctance to create competitors/competition [Most tech companies are monopolised]
* Trade secrets provision in TRIPs?
* Patenting traditional, indigenous knowledge [eg. Turmeric, Conus Magus]
* "Life" Patenting, Biopiracy [eg. Basmati Rice]
* IPR's as economic and trade instruments
* **Patent Protection is not absolute**. Sometimes individual rights have to be sacrificed for greater national interest.
  * eg. IPR and Public Health: Anthrax Scare, Anti-HIV Drugs

## Why Protect IP?
* Attracts investments that will create new jobs and opportunities
* Provides incentives for technological innovation
* Quick commercialization
* Prevents brain drain/ piracy
* Profit

## IPR and Innovation
* Theoretically, IPR protection encourages research and development. However, people are more accustomed to patent trolling.
* **Patent Trolling**: Perverting the law for profits while preventing innovation

## Alternative IPR Protection
* **Fair Use** as limited use of copyrighted material without permission (includes teaching)
* **Copyleft**: practice of offering people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of a work with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in the derived work
* **Open Source**: promotes universal access via free license
* **Creative Commons**
