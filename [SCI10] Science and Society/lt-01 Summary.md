# The Practice of Science and Technology

## Science and the Scientific Method
* **Science**: Rational Inquiry into nature
  * A **rational** inquiry into **nature** to understand what is happening around us
    * Scientific Method: Logical Structure/ Rational
    * Nature: Object of the inquiry
  * Object of inquiry separate from inquirer
  * Inquirer capable of rational inquisition
* **Roots of Science**
  * **Thales (ca. 585 BC)**: Idea of natural phenomena as something that can be explained by laws rather than the arbitrary acts of gods
    * Greek Ideal of Science: Systematic (Coherent), Certain, Universal
    * Your senses can fool you, use reason instead
  * **Plato (427-347 BC)**: Observation has little to do with true knowledge. Only "ideas" or contents of the mind are real.
    * eg. A real circle only exists in the mind
  * **Aristotle (384-322 BC)**: Sensible things are also real but inferior to ideas. They are particular manifestations of universal truths.
    * Observations: for discovery
    * The Mind: For validating or proving 
  * **Transition in Methods**: From RATIONAL+Empirical: Greeks to Copernicus [Heliocentric Theory]: Conceptualism is Strong) to RATIONAL+EMPIRICAL (Newton)
  * **Transition in Goals**: Complete Certainty to Probability a little short of certainty
    * There will always be the possibility of a counter example ï¼ˆeg. only need one black swan to prove not all swans are naturally white)
* **Conditions for empirical statements to constitute scientific knowledge**
  * Collection must be internally consistent (Repeatability)
  * Logical interrelationship between the statements
  * Able to deduce a prediction which can be tested (Falsifiability)
* **Types of statements**
  * Primitive statements of direct observation
  * Natural/Empirical Laws: A pattern from many observtions
  * Scientific Theory: Backed up by laws/theory, a cohesive body
  * Overarching fundamental principles
* **Two philosophical assumptions/articles of faith for science**
  * There is regularity in nature
  * The human mind can "know": We are capable of finding, knowing and understanding the regularity in nature
* **Kuhn Cycle**
  * Normal Science: "Ordinary" discoveries that agree with the paradigm
  * Model Drift: When anomalies go against normal science
  * Model Crisis: The paradigm can no longer support the anomalies
  * Model Revolution: When a competing paradigm can explain anomalies
  * Shift in Paradigm
    * The old understanding is left behind, and a new concept is generated
    * Occurs when certain anomalies cannot be explained by the prevailing paradigm. The crisis brings about a change in world view.
    * eg. Geocentric Model, Transition from Ptolemaic to Copernican cosmology (The earth revolves around the sun), Continental Drift (Alfred Wegener)
* **The Scientific Method**
  * The *well-posed problem*: A problem that can be stated with enough clarity and definiteness that it is guaranteed a solution
  * Ask a question, Do Background Research, Construct Hypothesis, Test with an Experiment, Analyze Results/ Draw Conclusion, Report Results
  * **What do we communicate in Science?**: As a Scientist, it is your obligation to report results in a journal, book or a conference
  * The Scientific Method: A "Comic Distortion"
    * **Pros**
      * Provides a systematic approach/guiding framework under the current paradigm
      * Allows for repeatability
      * Stresses rigor, honesty and integrity
    * **Cons**
      * Often not as straightforward as described
      * No guarantee of a breakthrough
      * Does not explicitly account for serendipity, insight or creativity
* **Honesty in Science**
  * Science cannot afford errors because it's very expensive in terms of time, resources and careers.
  * Articles may end up being inconsequential, of significance to other researchers, or erroneous
  * **Peer Review**: System to improve validity of article publications
  * **Controversial Frauds**
    * **Dr. Hwang Woo-Suk**
      * Announced he cloned a cow, and successful human somatic cell cloning in two papers published in Science
      * Investigation by SNU found him guilty of scientific fraud (data fabrication)
    * **Glaciergate Scandal**
      * The IPCC benchmark report claimed that the glaciers in the Himalayas could vanish by 2035.
      * It turned out to be wrong (based only on a popular science news) and has seriously damaged the credibility of the IPCC report
    * **The Missing Link Fraud**
      * The National Geographic declared American paleontologists discovered the missing link: Feathered Dinosaurs
      * The paper was previously rejected by peer reviewed journals as it was a sensational fraud.
    * **Waksman-Schatz Controversy**
      * Dr. Selman Waksman was a professor of soil microbiology, was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of *streptomycin*
      * The discovery was done by his PhD student Albert Schatz
      * Evidence of Discovery: The two peer-reviewed papers and dissertation of Schatz
    * **Mark Hauser Fraud**
      * Marc Hauser was a professor of psychology, a leader in the field of animal and human cognition
      * He became famous for his findings that monkeys can draw correct conclusions about novel situations
      * He was found guilty of scientific misconduct (data fabrication) in 3 important peer-reviewed publications
  * **Scientific Retraction**: Withdrawing a published paper
    * Most common cause: Scientific Misconduct
    * A retraction is very damaging to the researcher's and institution's reputation
    * Fraudulent or faulty research can be retracted by the authors or by the journal concerned
  * **Science is unforgiving to the dishonest**
    * The bastions of good science can be duped by an *ethically impaired scientist*
    * The *pressure to publish* can motivate even the most brilliant researchers to plagiarize, fudge data and play loose with their methods.
    * Plagiarising leads to *retraction* and *banishment from the science community*.
* **Objectivity in Science** 
    * Hypotheses and theories are objectively tested against experiments
    * Such an objective procedure would seem little room for personal prejudice
    * Individual scientists are not emotionally detached from their research. Rather, the scientific method draws its strength from the community of scientists
    * It is through this collective activity that objectivity emerges
  * **Science is a deeply social activity**: Conferences, Workshops, Peer Review, Professional Organizations
    * Getting networks of your peers, sharing your ideas/research findings with others
  * **Creativity in Science (Serendipity)**: Science is a creative endeavor; it is not merely a collection of facts
    * **Examples of Eureka Moments in Science**
      * **Percy LeBaron Spencer**: Discovered the microwave oven while
      * **Archimedes**: Discovered buoyancy, displacement
      * **Friedrich **: Discovered C6H6 (Organic Chemistry)
      * **Charles**: Rubber Melts (?)
      * **Alexander Flemming**: Discovered Penicillin
  * **The Limits of Science**: Cannot deal with morality or the existence of God
* **Misc Terms**
  * Weltanschauung: Scientific worldview
  * Scientific Paradigm: Model of a scientific discipline/ Interpretation of the physical world
  * The absolute certainty of dogmas/absolute authority is anathema to science.
  * Science may give us the tools, but how we use the tools is beyond science.
    * Helps us with empirical parts of problems by making informed and rational decisions

## Technology, Society and National Development
* **What is Technology?**
  * Human application of knowledge into the making of tools and the use of natural resources
    * Knowledge: Non-material (Values, attitudes, beliefs, ideology)
    * Tools: High and Low tech material - apparatus, activities and organizational networks
  * Science is knowing *why*, while technology is knowing *how*
* **Toffler's Waves of Technology**
  * **Invention of Agriculture**: Accumulation of production surplus led to subsequent cultural advances
  * **Industrial Revolution**: Steam/Internal Combustion Engines/Mass Production/Rise of Engineering
  * **Information Age/ Knowledge Wars**: Advances in Physics/Molecular Biology/Chemistry, Computing, Telecommunications, Control, Robotics
* **Impact of Technology**
  * Improved the quality of life: Changed lifestyles, attitudes and values
  * S&T has become the most important factor for **national economic growth and the source of competitive advantage**
    * Technologically autonomous, Technology strategy
    * LDC Technological Dead-Ends: Jeepney and Tricycle (Highly polluting and unsafe)
    * Third Wave in LDC: Cuba (Biotechnology), presence of technology =/= advanced
  * S&T identifies as the **principal means to fuel the nation's economy** and ensure the well-being of all Filipinos.
* **Getting out of the rut**
  * Active government intervention in:
    * Mobilizing domestic capital and controlling foreign investment
    * Establishing R&D facilities and building up skilled manpower
    * Providing necessary business and R&D incentives
  * Technological competence leads to technological development

## A Note on Intellectual Property Rights
* **Intellectual Property Rights**: Ease of reproduction, storage and dissemination
* **How do we protect the authors and inventors?**
  * **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)**: Rights granted to an author or inventor for exclusive right over the use of his/her creation for a certain period of time
    * **Copyrights**: Rights given to creators of original literary, scientific and artistic works
    * **Trademarks**: Words, phrase, symbol or design that identifies and distinguishes a product from another
    * **Patents**: Rights over the manufacture, use and marketing of inventions
      * Designed to prevent problems:
        * Free riding problem: Inventions are free for anyone to copy
        * Secrecy Problem: No incentive for inventors, thereby keeping everything secret
      * Patents can also cover ideas, designs and plans that have never been produced
        * Patenting product vs process
    * **Plagiarism**: Uncredited use of someone else's words or ideas
  * **International Agreements**
    * 1994 TRIPs: Trade-related aspects of IPR
    * 2001 Doha Declaration: Amendments on interpretations of TRIPs provisions
* **Enforcement Problems**
  * LDC's don't enforce IPR's as strictly due to several limitations, leading to the production of imitation products.
  * Spread of modern information technology made possible the rampant copying of books and other publications, music (internet digitization), movie piracy, etc.
  * **Napster**: Large-scale free file-sharing, which we now known as **Bit-torrent**
  * Not feasible to chase after sharers (college students), arguing as to how much benefit it actually brings and how it's impossible to catch every single sharer
  * Pushes for a new business model in the music industry (pay what you want)
* **Discontent with IPR Rules**
  * **US/EC vs South Korea**
    * Korea granted protection to processes over products, but the US threatened trade sanctions unless it patented both [to US pharmaceuticals]. The EC decided they also wanted these patents and pressured Korea to do the same.
  * **US vs Brazil**
    * Brazil did not have laws granting protection to either processes or products. The US pressured Brazil the same way they did with Korea.
  * **LDC Criticisms against TRIPs**
    * Hindering tech transfer to IP-poor least developing countries (No protection against abuse)
      * Patent Trolling: Company attempts to enforce patents against accused infringers (Apple vs Samsung)
      * Lack of competencies in LDC's for effective transfer
      * Reluctance to create competitors/competition [Most tech companies are monopolised]
    * The provisions of TRIPs allow the patenting of indigenous knowledge and practices [eg. Turmeric, Yoga, Conus Magus]
    * TRIPs is too lax in preventing "life patenting" or biopiracy [eg. Basmati Rice, Ayabuasca Vine, Mexican Yellow Beans]
* **Theoretical Perspectives of IPR**
  * Economic Development: The strong do as they will, the weak do as they must
  * Public Health: eg. Anthrax Spores, Anti-HIV in Africa
  * R&D, Innovation: Ideally helpful, but subject to a lot of abuse
  * Human Rights: Baikal Environmental Wave
* **Why Protect IPR?**
  * Attracts investments that will create new jobs and opportunities
  * Provides incentives for technological innovation
  * Quick commercialization
  * Prevents brain drain/ piracy
  * Profit
* **Alternative IPR Protection**
  * **Fair Use** as limited use of copyrighted material without permission (includes teaching)
  * **Copyleft**: practice of offering people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of a work with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in the derived work
  * **Open Source**: promotes universal access via free license
  * **Creative Commons**
    * Attribution, Noncommercial, Noderivative, Share Alike

## Summary
* Science is dynamic
* **Scientific Method**
  * Emphasis on Experiments (Empirical)
  * Should be repeatable [Peer Review Process]
  * Falsifiable or Testable Statements
* **Technology**
  * Strongly correlated with national development
  * Issue on disasters and how they set us back
    * We are stuck in a rut, but technology can help us out of it through proper education, training and infrastructure to carry on and develop technology
