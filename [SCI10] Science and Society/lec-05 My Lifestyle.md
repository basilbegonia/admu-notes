# A Digital Age

## Ted Talk Review
* **Infernal talking machines**
  * Effect on creating culture: Afraid it would go from read/write to read-only
* **Plane flying over farm**: court decided planes were not trespassing because of common sense
  * Inventions of airplanes made people rethinktrespass law
* **ASCAP vs BMI**: Broadcasting Towers
  * ASCAP had the IPR's for music and had monopoly at that time, BMI had to pay ASCAP for music
  * They raised their patent by 400% => People shifted to free version provided by BMI (provided an alternative)

## Digital Technologies
* Binary form, innovation that has evolved
  * Like the plane, causes us to rethink laws and policies (eg. Intellectual Property Rights)
  * Technically, remixing is considered illegal
* Easier to be part of culture creation, adding and storing data
* **Digitization**: 
* **Analog vs Digital**:
  * Analog: Uses physical characteristics to measure something (eg. Analog clocks, mercury in thermometers)
  * Digital: Transmits information in bits
    * Bits: Short for binary digits
    * ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Exchange (eg. 10000001 = A)
    * 1 byte = 8 bits
* **Sound**: An analog signal
  * Vibration in an elastic medium at a frequency that can be heard by the human ear (20-20,000 Hz)
    * Causes changes in pressure
  * Longitudinal Wave: Slinky
  * **Resolution**: How often you sample a signal
    * Sampling the signal: Checking the value at certain intervals
    * Converting from analog to digital: Check times more often
    * Low Res vs High Res: Storage Space, Computing Power
  * **Nyquist Criterion**: 
    * To get a good representation of your analog signal, you have to sample faster than the highest frequency content of the signal
    * Frequency (Hz): number of vibrations in a second 

## Telecommunications in a Digital Age
* Long distance communication: The basic purpose of any communication network is to transmit content from one location to another
* Communication advances hand-in-hand with transportation: From physical mail to e-mails
* **Advances in Electricity and Magnetism**: 
  * Telegraph and Morse code (dots and dashes, early form of 0's and 1's)
  * Telephone: Alexander Grahambell => Rotary Phone, Wireless Phones, Cellphones
* Telecommunications in the Philippines
  * RA3436: Franchise to install, operate and maintain a telephone OS in the PH (1928)
  * RA6146: Upgrade party line services to main lines with switching offices (1970)
  * 2010: 6.783M landlines but 92.28M cellphone lines
* Recent trends in telecommunications: Going digital, wireless and small
