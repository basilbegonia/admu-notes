# Post Marriage and Religion

* Women raised pigs because they believed it'd make them pregnant
* **Three reasons for Circumcision**
  * Muslim tradition
  * Trade: Secret Handshake, easiest way was to accept their way of life
  * Sexual: Women gravitated to men who were circumcised because it was "something different"
  * **Process**: 
    * Put 8=D on a chopping board, prefer a male doctor because they're stronger, usually done when men are of age
    * Goal's to make 8=D numb by striking it several times
    * Use cutlass to get rid of the skin, spit antiseptic on genitalia
    * Wash in the river
  * **Antonio Pigafetta**
    * Males wore a bahag, penises pierced one side to another near the head, resembling a spur(?)
    * Males insert genitalia with "devices" in an angle which isn't let go until they ejaculate [ensures "communication" happens]
    * Used mainly for procreation
* (p.27) As soon as the young wife conceived, she and her husband immediately observed **certain practices (pamahiin)**
  * Raised pigs and sacrificed at birth to the anito
  * **Anito**: Environmental spirits [replaced by saints] responsible in making the women pregnant, whereas men only acted as vessels
    * **Tiktik**: 
      * Man should stay in the house otherwise the creature'd attack. 
      * It attaches itself to the house of a person and drops a very long tongue attaching to the woman's womb and sucks the baby out. 
      * People place stakes on their roofs.
    * Don't eat peanuts/beans because it'll make your child dull, sometimes fish as well.
    * Husband does not cut his hair until his wife delivers, as his child would not be born otherwise [not that prevalent]
  * (p.28) They were likewise prohibited from eating bananas that are joined one with another or any other food athat are two in one because they believed they would give birth to 2 creatures from the same womb to which they consider a great insult.
  * They were also warned from eating 2 upwards from a plate
  * This belief system attests to the fact that having multiple children is not desirable, especially those inhabiting near the sea. Abortion takes place from people not being able to afford many children.
  * Women on their first pregnancy are averse to climbing any house if htey are not given a little buyo or salt
  * (p.29) As soon as the child is born, several taboos were observed. It was believed that if rice were to fall from the mortar and eaten by chickens, the child would die.
  * (p.29 3rd) Child naming was done as soon as the child was a few days old. The child was named by its mother after certain circumstances attended to the birth [how the mom felt during the birth], or [the first thing the baby sees after birth]
    * **Pat-ama, pat-ina**
  * Bringing up the child during pre-Spanish days: The mother taught the daughter the female rules of the house while the father trained the son to become a warrior. When the boy reached 8, they were taught to use bow/arrows/lances/spears. Sometimes, the chief would kill [read the thing]. In order to teach boys how to kill, they get corpses of enemies and let kids hack them. 
  * **Lubloba (Village Idiot)**: takes his little son, sneak up behind a co-citizen, and helps the boy jab a spear into the buttocks
  * Spanish wanted the Filipinos to appear barbaric so they could paint their image of Christianity

## Religion and Belief System
* **Belief System**
  * The pre conquest Filipinos had a body of beliefs which has survived the onslaught of time and functions in many rural and upland areas today as a point of reference in various action processes
    * eg. 'Tabi tabi po' bec of dwarves
    * **Animism**: 
      * Belief that there are spirits in nature
      * Nature is active
      * Focused on the worship on Environmental spirits
      * **Anito**: Environmental spirits (good)
      * Monotheistic
* **Religious Structures**
  * That is why there were no temples or stone buildings in the PH similar to those obtaining elsewhere. Megalithic structures were constructed only im permanent, large communities and by strong political leaders either for residence, religious worship or bureaucracy. Thus to speak of temples and kings in the PH, as I shall show later, is to exaggerate the sociological contexts (p.4-5)
    * **Religion/Mythology Hierarchy**
      * Bathala (God): Monotheism
      * Anito/Environmental Spirits
      * Creatures: Physycal
    * There exist priests (**Babaylan or Catalonan**) who serve as mediums for talking to the deities
      * Mostly reserved for women
  * Male: Datu, political, social, economic
  * Female: Catalonan, Babaylan, religion, finding cures, getting rid of environmental spirits
    * **Anting-anting/agimat/talisman**: Object that gives you extraordinary powers
      * Important bec of warrior culture and ensuring soldiers' safe travels
      * Replaced by scapula and rosary when Spanish arrived
      * Respectful, but afraid
    * **Gayuman**: Love potion/ concoction that forces you to do something
      * Urine salts into pills before intercourse; there's something in urine that makes people attractive/hormones
    * Getting sick = offending an anito, therefore need to find a medium to appease them
    * Deities are usually male and don't necessarily wanna talk to other males
    * Male Catalonan/Babaylan need to look like women
  * Religion has a **large correlation with medicine**: Women are good with medicine so they're seen as the keepers of religion - because they're more observant
  * If an animal is wounded, men would kill it, but women would be incapaciated and only observe how they treat themselves
* **Religion**
* (p.6) Should any member of the family become seirously ill or die, the people believed that the spirits of the **fields** had been offended and therefore residents should move out. The dwellings were either left behind or burnt before departure.
  * Why we don't have temples
  * Babaylan uses a pendulum: What it swings to is what you've offended, then goes to the room and asks what offer it wants
