# Commercial Revolution

## 15th-16th Century Europe/ Spanish
* Why did the Spanish arrive in this era
* What was happening in the PH in 16th century EU that forced them to arrive here?
  * Right after the so called middle/dark ages

## Shift in Trade
* EU is a body of water which is land locked (Mediterranian), surrounded by Greeks, Rome, Africa
* Up to the 13th century, the whole world revolves around the Mediterranian territory
* In the 15th century, there was a shift. Trade shifted from the Mediterranian to a new body of water (**Atlantic**)
* They were now open to the new world and no longer trapped to in Mediterranian
* New countries who benefited: Spain, Portugal, British, France, Dutch
* Shift in Trade = **Shift in Power**, new territories

## Shift in Economy
* The first forms of economy focused on agriculture, trade and land (Feudalism)
* **Mercantilism**: A counter's power and wealth is gained by **Gold**/ the number of precious metals it can accumulate
  * Why gold/metal rather than land? Land was very difficult to trade and saturated the economy (eg. Cannot sell land in America)
  * People were now removed from their territories and can become more mobile, leading to a new age
* **Bullionism**: 
* Followed by Industrialism, Capital, Knowledge based economy/ Information age
* **Age of Exploration or Discovery**
  * Forefront of age are the territories closer to the Atlantic
  * Why people were exploring
    * **New and Exotic Products**
      * Marco Polo: Italian explorer who eventually got lost in China
      * When he returned, he brought a treasure chest. People started to crave for Asian products
      * Jumpstarted products (Fascinated mostly because of how products were made): 
        * Silk: they didn't know how it was made - it's very light, fireproof
        * Porcelain: they have bronze, metals etc and never had white things
    * **Religion**: Spread of Catholicism
      * Blanket for true intentions: exploitations
      * Seen as humanism they needed to do; to westernize brown monkeys running around the world
      * Spain were known as *Conquistador*: military and religious conquest
        * Defeating an enemy: *Entrada*
    * **Hegemon**: 
      * A powerful country, kingdom or territory if you can send definitions to different parts of the world
      * They want to place their flags on what they believe are different parts of the world
      * It's a new trend for them; they know something's out there, and they want to be the first
    * **Trade Routes**
      * Silk Road: connects EU and Asia (nothing new), but the trade was very limited (13 horses)
        * Problem: Whole territory that caravans pass through was controlled by the Moslems
          * Very difficult because Catholicism and Islam want to eradicate each other (Crusades)
          * They want to remove the Moslems from the cave
          * Crossing the silk road makes prices go from $10 to $10 to $50 because of Moslems limiting how much they earn
        * How to remove them? Find new routes
      * People knew the earth was round, and wanted to travel west to end up at the east
    * **Instruments/ Transportation**
      * Navigation: 
        * Galleons had a characteristic that was unrivaled at that time (**Bodega/Storage**)
        * You can now transport goods back to your country
      * Travel
      * Storage and Transportation
      * There were new developments in terms of instruments for transportation
        * Compass, Astrolabe(???), Maps (Star Maps, Constellations), Telescope

## Spanish
* **Reasons for being near the forefront**
  * Protectors of the Catholic faith: Being close with the Catholic Church = Wealth
  * Geographical Location: The Atlantic is right in front of them
  * Explorers/Conquistadors: They were very successful explorers
    * **Hernan Cortez**: After him, everyone wanted a piece of a pie
      * Mostly associated with events in Mexico: Wiped the Aztecs out
      * Not that successful, but the way he did it was successful
      * His accomplishments became the blue print for successful expeditions
        * **Superior weapons and tactics**
          * Aztecs were unknowledgeable of gunpowder and very unafraid
          * In the PH, we were not afraid because we've seen them from China
        * **Brought the common flu or the plague**
          * The Aztecs did not have any resistance towards the flu, and a simple cold dwindled the population
          * The PH had so much colonisers (SP, US, JP, KR), and we're still overpopulated
        * **HC was perceived as god**
          * Aztecs believed Quetzalcotal would return one day, but didn't know what he'd look like
          * Conditions for their god:
            * Giant: HC was riding a horse, and looked gigantic
            * Shiny: HC was wearing a shining armor, and had feathers on his head
          * Aztecs wanted to appease HC and introduced him to the City of God (**El Dorado**)
      * **Ferdinand Magellan**: Inspired by HC, and known to be the first circumnavigator of the world
