# Philippine Pre-History

* Filipinos through **Nature Cycles**, which are composed of two parts
  * Day and Night, Rain and Hot (Weather), Plant and Harvest, Life and Death
  * Due to animistic beliefs - everything happens over and over again
  * Never paid attention to the small details in history
* **1521**: When the Spanish arrived, history stopped being cyclic and became **linear** (European Concept)
  * **Precolonial**: Pre-history, Dark, Barbarian
  * **Colonial**: History, Light, Civilized) Periods
  * Before the arrival of the Spanish, it was dark [they believed there was light in dark things].
* **19th Century**: The Propaganda Movement (Heroes of the Philippines)
  * People started questioning if this was how we were supposed to look at history 
  * **Jose Rizal**: Edited the timeline of history 
    * Precolonial Period: Paradise (We were happy before the arrival of the Spanish)
    * Colonial Period: Made us lose paradise
    * Postcolonial Period: Paradise comes again
  * **Andres Bonifacio**: Katipunan, Revolution 
    * Held interviews for KKK aspirants:
      * Precolonial Period: What is the condition of the Philippines before? [Happy, Free]
      * Colonial Period: What is the condition of the Philippines during the Spanish occupation? [Distraught, bad things]
      * Postcolonial Period: What is the condition of the Philippines after the Spanish occupation? [Freedom again]
    * After answering questions, sign your name in blood
      * Not sure about actually happening 
    * **Problem**: Our history focuses on **colonial** periods; do we have a history without it?
      * Need to focus on the Filipinos and local inhabitants

* **Myths** regarding how people arrived in the Philippines
  * **Oven**: 
    * Bathala became lonely, and molded human beings out of his own image. He decided to cook individuals in the oven [to breathe life to them]. 
    * In the first batch, he didn't pay attention [Dark], and threw them into Africa.
    * In the second batch, he was too eager [White], and threw them into Europe.
    * Last batch, the people came out perfect and he put them in the Philippines
    * **Interesting Facts**
      * Believing we were chosen by god
      * Concept of an oven before they existed: Not sure if myth was applicable to prehistory 
  * **Bamboo**: 
    * Sea was thrashing and ended up flooding the sky, along with the garden of Bathala [which had bamboo]. The bamboo started flowing downstream to where the Philippines was created
      * We came from god's garden and his favorite tree
    * The bird flying around pecked the bamboo and it opened - out came Malakas and Maganda
    * **Interesting facts:**
      * There is a notion of a great flood (Similar to China, Bible, Gilgamesh) because life came from a sea
      * Bamboo may have been a boat: Balangkay => Barangay
* **The Peopling Process**
  * One of these islands a reed grew. The Kite, now having a place to alight, came down and pecked at the reed. The reed broke into two sections and out came the first man and woman. At first the woman hesitated to marry the man but later consented after having consulted the tunas of the sea, the dove and the earthquake. (pg. 38)
  * From the union of this original pair came many children. One day the father came home tired and hungry. For some reason he became angry at the children, who fled to different parts of the house and surrounding places. Some hid inside rooms, some behind the walls, some in the fireplace, and others fled to the sea.
  * It it said that those who fled the most hidden rooms are the chiefs of the islands. Those who remained nearer outside are the timaguas, and those who hid themselves in the fireplace are the blacks, and those who fled out through though the open door to the sea were the Spaniards, and they had no news of us until they beheld us return through the sea.
  * Creates an impression that solidifies the idea of how we were populated
  * **Implications**:
    * Spanish are long lost brothers
    * Timaguas, Blacks, Chiefs of Islands
  * **How the PH got populated**: 
    * Austronesian-speaking (SE Asia and Oceania) people migrated
* **Narratives**: People who were with the colonisers and wrote everything down. Without them, we wouldn't have anything at all and rely on only archaelogical remains
  * Miguel de Loarca
  * Juan Plasencia
  * Pedro Chirino
  * Antonio de Morga: 
    * Sucesos de las islas Filipinas: One of the most important works on the early history of PH
    * Bias: "Filipinos love eating rotten[fermented] food and fruits" (eg. Patis, Durian)
