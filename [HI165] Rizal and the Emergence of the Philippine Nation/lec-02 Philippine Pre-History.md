# Philippine Pre-History

* Filipinos through **Nature Cycles**, which are composed of two parts
  * Day and Night, Rain and Hot (Weather), Plant and Harvest, Life and Death
  * Due to animistic beliefs - everything happens over and over again
  * Never paid attention to the small details in history
* **1521**: When the Spanish arrived, history stopped being cyclic and became **linear** (European Concept)
  * **Precolonial**: Pre-history, Dark, Barbarian
  * **Colonial**: History, Light, Civilized) Periods
  * Before the arrival of the Spanish, it was dark [they believed there was light in dark things].
* **19th Century**: The Propaganda Movement (Heroes of the Philippines)
  * People started questioning if this was how we were supposed to look at history 
  * **Jose Rizal**: Edited the timeline of history 
    * Precolonial Period: Paradise (We were happy before the arrival of the Spanish)
    * Colonial Period: Made us lose paradise
    * Postcolonial Period: Paradise comes again
  * **Andres Bonifacio**: Katipunan, Revolution 
    * Held interviews for KKK aspirants:
      * Precolonial Period: What is the condition of the Philippines before? [Happy, Free]
      * Colonial Period: What is the condition of the Philippines during the Spanish occupation? [Distraught, bad things]
      * Postcolonial Period: What is the condition of the Philippines after the Spanish occupation? [Freedom again]
    * After answering questions, sign your name in blood
      * Not sure about actually happening 
    * **Problem**: Our history focuses on **colonial** periods; do we have a history without it?
      * Need to focus on the Filipinos and local inhabitants

* **Myths** regarding how people arrived in the Philippines
  * **Oven**: 
    * Bathala became lonely, and molded human beings out of his own image. He decided to cook individuals in the oven [to breathe life to them]. 
    * In the first batch, he didn't pay attention [Dark], and threw them into Africa.
    * In the second batch, he was too eager [White], and threw them into Europe.
    * Last batch, the people came out perfect and he put them in the Philippines
    * **Interesting Facts**
      * Believing we were chosen by god
      * Concept of an oven before they existed: Not sure if myth was applicable to prehistory 
  * **Bamboo**: 
    * Sea was thrashing and ended up flooding the sky, along with the garden of Bathala [which had bamboo]. The bamboo started flowing downstream to where the Philippines was created
      * We came from god's garden and his favorite tree
    * The bird flying around pecked the bamboo and it opened - out came Malakas and Maganda
    * **Interesting facts:**
      * There is a notion of a great flood (Similar to China, Bible, Gilgamesh) because life came from a sea
      * Bamboo may have been a boat: Balangkay => Barangay
* **The Peopling Process (p.38)**
  * One of these islands a reed grew. The Kite, now having a place to alight, came down and pecked at the reed. The reed broke into two sections and out came the first man and woman. At first the woman hesitated to marry the man but later consented after having consulted the tunas of the sea, the dove and the earthquake. (pg. 38)
  * From the union of this original pair came many children. One day the father came home tired and hungry. For some reason he became angry at the children, who fled to different parts of the house and surrounding places. Some hid inside rooms, some behind the walls, some in the fireplace, and others fled to the sea.
  * It it said that those who fled the most hidden rooms are the chiefs of the islands. Those who remained nearer outside are the timaguas, and those who hid themselves in the fireplace are the blacks, and those who fled out through though the open door to the sea were the Spaniards, and they had no news of us until they beheld us return through the sea.
  * Creates an impression that solidifies the idea of how we were populated
  * **Implications**:
    * Spanish are long lost brothers
    * Timaguas, Blacks, Chiefs of Islands
  * **How the PH got populated**: 
    * Austronesian-speaking (SE Asia and Oceania) people migrated through the **Balanghai** (30-50 individuals)
      * Balanghai eventually became Barangay (p.9): the term got retained by newcomers to apply to their community. It is a family of parents, children, relatives and slaves.
  * **Theories in Peopling**
    * Mainland Origin Hypothesis: Austronesians came from South China& Taiwan [Peter Bellwood]
    * Island Origin Hypothesis: Austronesians originated and from island SE Asia [Wilhelm Solheim]
  * **Landa Jocano**: Filipino culture began evolving from within, and not as a part of the larger SE cultural milieu
* **Settlement Pattern of Early Community (p.3-4)**
  * Population settled mostly near water areas
    * **Positive**: 
      * **Food**
        * Protein: fish, shrimp, shells and eels
        * Since their protein sucked, Spaniards told Pampanga to produce large amounts of eggs [eg. leche flan, meringue]
        * Domesticated animals like pigs, carabaos and chicken were ritual and festival foods: not part of the daily diet 
      * **Transportation**: Most accessible areas get most amounts of trade
      * **Trade**: Strategic commercial points
    * Negative: Security [vulnerable from many areas]
  * Villages ranged from 50 to 2,000 people
  * Economic reasons: most important motivating factors underlying residential preferences.
  * Because of trade, many of the coastal communities visited and described by early Spanish chroniclers were emerging commercial centers. Economic affluence brought about four distinct social classes:
    * **Datu/Dato (Chief)**
      * Passed by inheritance or challenging and beating the current datu
      * Absolute power over their constituents (eg. overseeing marriage)
    * **Maharlika (Nobility)**
      * Seems as a nobility (eg. Aristocrats, Royalty) due to European culture/naming schemes
      * In the PH, they're mostly advisers: rich, but not noble
      * Did not pay taxes or tribute to the datu
    * **Timagua (Common)**: "Free Men" (No attachments) by Loarca
    * **Alipin (Dependent)**
      * Normally equated to as slaves; however, they still have rights ("Katulong")
        * Otherwise we'd have the large structures built by European slavery
        * Namamahay: Debt, Son (as a form of dowry); mostly temporary
        * Saguiguilid: Forever (eg. ask permission from masters to get married)
        * Caused by debt, being a prisoner of war, or being a criminal
  * Leadership Pattern also changed (p.8-9?)
* **Political Structure (p.20)**
  * Family oriented: magkakaibigan and magkaka-anak; kinship relations
    * It never grew because the population of PH was very small: there was no need to change how people had to be managed
    * We are one of the few countries who never had a king
  * Weakness of the structure comes from Datu's imposition of fines to his followers who would move to another barangay without his knowledge
  * (Something from p.20)
  * All societies were structured in which a person reckoned relationships with both the paternal and maternal kinsmen.
* **Way of Life**
  * **Boxer Codex**: Talks about the inhabitants [in the PH] and what they did
  * **Houses (p.7)**
    * Bahay Kubo (spn. cubo)
    * One room, made from organic materials, isolated
    * Raised 3-4 meters above the ground to prevent wild animals from getting inside, keeping livestock (convenience of security and feeding)
    * Temporary, built in the middle of nowhere
    * Communal use
* **Military**
  * Weapons: Long for 'far' combat
  * **Headhunting (p.19)**: Using a bararao/palacul
    * To make sure person actually died [mostly for leaders/ important individuals]
    * Lessens the bloodshed (War ends after leader is decapitated)
  * **Inter Barangay Raids**
    * Not only for head taking, but also for slavery [take as slaves, sold to slavery, sold to community]
      * Decapitate datu to take control of the barangay and get people
      * Transform regular people into dependent/alipin is more valuable than killing that person [most important commodity]
      * If chiefly class are captured, they were offered for ransom in gold, or as slaves for life
    * Tinguianes fight after their harvest are done (no regular military, just the farmers/workers)
    * **Causes of raids**
      * Unwarranted killing of natives in another town [fight back before more people die and numbers reduce]
      * Stealing wives
      * Treachery when one goes in a friendly manner to another village trade
    * **How to scare enemies before fighting**
      * More alliances/ merge with another barangay [Increase numbers]
      * More weapons
      * Pintados ("Painted Ones"): Body art/tattoos to scare enemies
        * Keeps records of battles, death, courage
        * Horizontal lines: Mountains, Curvy lines: Water
* **Marriage**
  * Loarca corroborated this account when he wrote about the Bisayan
    * It is considered a disgrace among them to have many children; for they say that when the property is to be divided among many children [it's easier to manage things economically with one kid
  * Women raised pigs because they believed it'd make them pregnant
  * **Three reasons for Circumcision**
    * Muslim tradition
    * Trade: Secret Handshake, easiest way was to accept their way of life
    * Sexual: Women gravitated to men who were circumcised because it was "something different"
    * **Process**: 
      * Put 8=D on a chopping board, prefer a male doctor because they're stronger, usually done when men are of age
      * Goal's to make 8=D numb by striking it several times
      * Use cutlass to get rid of the skin, spit antiseptic on genitalia
      * Wash in the river
    * **Antonio Pigafetta**
      * Males wore a bahag, penises pierced one side to another near the head, resembling a spur(?)
      * Males insert genitalia with "devices" in an angle which isn't let go until they ejaculate [ensures "communication" happens]
      * Used mainly for procreation
  * (p.27) As soon as the young wife conceived, she and her husband immediately observed **certain practices (pamahiin)**
    * Raised pigs and sacrificed at birth to the anito
    * Anito: Environmental spirits [replaced by saints] responsible in making the women pregnant, whereas men only acted as vessels
      * **Tiktik**: Man should stay in the house otherwise the creature'd attack. It attaches itself to the house of a person and drops a very long tongue attaching to the woman's womb and sucks the baby out. People place stakes on their roofs.
      * Don't eat peanuts/beans because it'll make your child dull, sometimes fish as well.
      * Husband does not cut his hair until his wife delivers, as his child would not be born otherwise [not that prevalent]
    * (p.28) They were likewise prohibited from eating bananas that are joined one with another or any other food athat are two in one because they believed they would give birth to 2 creatures from the same womb to which they consider a great insult.
    * They were also warned from eating 2 upwards from a plate
    * This belief system attests to the fact that having multiple children is not desirable, especially those inhabiting near the sea. Abortion takes place from people not being able to afford many children.
    * Women on their first pregnancy are averse to climbing any house if htey are not given a little buyo or salt
    * (p.29) As soon as the child is born, several taboos were observed. It was believed that if rice were to fall from the mortar and eaten by chickens, the child would die.
    * (p.29 3rd) Child naming 
    * Spanish wanted the Filipinos to appear barbaric so they could paint their image of Christianity



* **Narratives**: People who were with the colonisers and wrote everything down. Without them, we wouldn't have anything at all and rely on only archaelogical remains
