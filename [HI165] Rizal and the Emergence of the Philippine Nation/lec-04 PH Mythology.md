# Philippine Mythology

## Creatures in PH Mythology
* When the Spanish came to the PH, they had a hard time making the natives believe in heaven
  * PH belief there was no heaven or hell
  * They just know they're going to a place after they die, but not where
* Used to scare people and avoid dwindling of population, "pananakot"

  * Female, as big as a hippo
  * While father is sleeping, she will tiptoe and jump to the bed
  * Keeps on jumping until the life force is collected and suffocated you
  * Explanation for nightmares
  * Weird because concept of "life force" because the Spanish taught that God "breathed life onto us"

  * **Main Goal**: Explains nightmares, and why their chest pounds when they wake up
* **Aswang**

    * Lets the Babaylan create **Anting-Anting** and attach them to your leg
    * Lets men remember where they're going in their journeys

## Death and Burial
* A big part of the component of the belief system is the concept of death
* Religion has been a huge indication that a society is flourishing
  * Conceptualising a religion is very difficult to do while alive
  * You need a lot of imagination to be able tocreate a religion
  * **Why?**
    * If you need a lot of creativity in creating a concept of the religion, then it means there's a **surplus in food**
      * Why does surplus indicate strong connections with religion?
        * If there's a surplus, not everyone's required to harvest/plant/hunt. It indicates that a segment of the population can do other segments or tasks.
    * There is a **specialisations**: Individuals who gather, stay at home, hunt, and do medicine, and religion
      * Having one religion indicates there is specialisation
      * It's more difficult to create more rituals in order to tell what happens when we die
* The idea of death and burial has a strong connection with the belief system that we have
  * **Afterlife**: One thing we know for sure that's common in other cultures
* **Different PH Death Rituals**:
  * Don't go home directly after a wake
  * Don't wear red
  * Don't go to sleep during the last night of the wake
  * Burning things for people to have luxuries in heaven (maids, houses)
  * Individuals being hired to cry (mourners)
  * **Why are they done?**
    * Indicates that a person is loved
    * A person is important
    * He will be received in the afterlife with great care and enthusiasm
      * Bathala and the anitos would pay no expense in accepting this person immediately in the afterlife. If the person's not important, they fall in line to get into heaven.
      * Not done for us, but for the entities that are going to receive
* (p.33) THe body of the dead was sponged with a concoction from boiled and pounded leaves and tubers, carefully wrapped in blankets, and embalmed. Then the ritual criers went around the village to announce the passing away of the dead man.
  * We are the only species in the world that gives importance to death and rituals
  * These rituals are very important and imply that a community is flourishing ; when a person dies, the whole community stops
* Poor were buried in ordinary graves dug underneath the house (poor people's bodies were left to decay), while those who were rich kept in one of the places:
  * Either in the upper part of the house with the jewels
  * Or the lower part of it, raised up from the ground
  * In an open whole surrounded with a small railing, without covering the coffin over the earth
* **Past**: Leave dead person in the house and throwing stones at the house: Indicates they don't want spirits to follow them, and abandoned houses to avoid spirits.
* **Some Rituals (p.34)**
  * Warriors Death
  * Mummification
  * Feasting
  * Mourning
* **How they were buried**
  * **Manuggul Jar**: The ethnic tribes of the PH used this vessel to transport the dead to the afterlife
    * Primary Burial: 
      * Person is buried underground, placed in a box and placed for several months until the body has decayed.
      * After the decaying process, they collect all of the bones and paint/dip it in red paint (symbol of death). 
    * Secondary Burial: 
      * They place the feet, torso, arms and skull inside the jar. 
      * They put the jar in a cave overlooking the sea. 
      * When the sunset hits the water, it creates a light in the water that looks like a stream connecting all the way to the cave.
       * It indicates that the vessel is a way for people to travel through a river of light.
       * It was not seen as a means of preserving the body.
    * Two figures on top: 
      * One is the dead person with his arms crossed (accepting where he has to go)
      * The other's the person taking you to the afterlife (steering the boat).
        * Means you're going where you have to be, rather than where you want to be
  * **Mummification**: Indication that the society is flourishing because mummification is expensive, time consuming and requires a lot of political and man power.
    * In the northern parts of Luzon, there are multiple mummified bodies placed inside capsules or coffins.
    * **Process**: Involves the whole community, usually in the mountain provinces
      * Attach the person on the post of the house and cover them with a lot of blankets (to remove all of the moisture, from food preservation => removing moisture from food to preserve it)
      * All the relatives will visit the house and cry, and wiping their tears on the person (process of mourning)
      * After a few days, when a person has slowly dried up, the relatives will place the person on a chair and place a basin underneath the chair. The whole set-up will be placed on top of a fire. All the body's fluids will be drained into the basin, which the family members will have to drink.
      * After all the moistures are removed, the person is forced into the fetal position. The person is placed in a coffin shaped like a woman's womb, indicating the person's going to be reborn.
    * **Hanging Coffins**
      * Attaching coffins to the cliff face/ side of the mountain
        * Run off water and flooding was common in those areas: Burying a person underneath would cause them to be uprooted
        * It's very difficult to bury people underneath because of mountain geography
  * **Tree Burials**: In the southern part of Luzon
    * In the 1970's, there was a mining group that visited Luzon and cut off a lot of trees. The trees were basically hollow and found the bones of dead people inside it.
    * A family tree: When a person dies, they attach the person to parts of the tree
    * **How do you place the remains of a person inside a fully grown tree?**
      * At a very young age, the father will tell the son "Let's search for my tree"
      * They will search for the young tree and teach the son how to make an incision in the tree. Every year, they visit the tree and place stones inside it.
      * As the years pass, the tree grows around the stones and turns hollow. 
      * When the father dies, the son removes the stones and places the body inside.
      * The body tightens the tree every year until the body is covered inside.
      * A way of indicating that the person's a part of nature
  * Burial processes were very similar to those of Catholic processes: Respecting and remembering the dead
    * The Filipinos quickly absorbed the culture of Catholicism
    * Rituals withstood the test of time because the Spanish didn't prevent them from doing it: it still focused on the core teachings of Catholicism
      * The only people who could bury relatives in the cemetery were the wealthy individuals
