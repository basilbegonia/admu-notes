# Spanish Colonization

* Political
  * Old: Datu, Timagua, Maharlika, ALipin
  * 1565: Miguel Lopez de Legazpi 
    * After the failure of Magellan's expedition, many were sent to the Philippines. 
    * He established the first Christian settlements found in the PH and in Cebu (Colonial Areas)
    * Manila
    * They were able to create a lot of colonial administrations
    * Changed the political landscape of the Philippines. They saw that there were problems in the PH they were not anticipating
      * There was no gold
      * The PH is rich not in resources but in human resources, and tried to transform the PH into a labor market instead of a gold mining place
    * Tried to make the PH into what's known as the Spanish colonial administration

## Spanish Colonial Administration
* **Barangay Level**: Mayor-esque, local level
  * **Regular People**: 
  * **Cabeza de Barangay**: Also the Datu
  * **Datu/Gobernadorcillo**: 
    * Highest PH authority in the Philippines (He wanted to preserve the original structure)
    * Preserved to keep order and leadership in the PH community
    * Highest position of authority a Filipino can achieve in the Philippines
    * Still feels in control of the barangay or community, but is now large of a largeer bureaucratic system
* **Alcalde**: Governor-esque, provincial level
* **Governor General**: Military-esque, national level
  * Executive, Legislative and Judicial duties
  * First GG: Miguel Lopez de Legazpi
* **Royal Audiencia**: Supreme court, 
  * Higher than the GG despite being governed by the GG
  * Different office, but still controlled by one individual
* **Council of Indies**: International, regional level
  * Responsible for managing the different colonies of Spain (eg. Cuba, Mexico, all Latin-american countries except Brazil)
  * We are technically under Mexico because we did not generate anything
  * Reports to Spain
* **Spain**: Theocratic form of government
  * **King**
  * **Catholic Church**

* Problem: 
  * The problem and solution gets lost because of the number of people you have to pass the problem to
  * It takes the boat 6 months to get to Spain, 6 months to get to the PH, and months to deliver the message
  * "Obedezco pero no cumplo" 

* Three Goals in the PH
  * Religion: How do you force the PH to accept Christianity at the same time forcing them into a civilization?
  * Civilization: Accept the Western way of life
    * **Plaza Complex**: Forces them to live in western towns, stone houses, and create permanent residences
    * **Reduccion**: Resettlement - you have to remove all indios from the bahay kubos and move them all into western settlements, in order to make them part of the economic, bureaucratic and political structure
      * How do you force these indios to live in these houses?
        * **Fiestas**: 
          * We have 200 celebrations with different saints
          * Religious or national celebrations
          * Created to make establishments seem happy (used Banderitas)
        * **Gifts or Bribery** 
          * Men: Food w/o hunting, Weapons
          * Women: Mirrors (Vanity), Comb
        * **Security**
      * Effects on Filipinos
        * Left behind their pagan way of life (leaving all traditions behind because there's no room for them)
        * Extraction of Wealth: they were charged with high taxes in form of money or service
        * Property and Riches: they believed Filipinos built their houses to hide gold underneath
      * **Center of Reduccion** is the Church (all roads lead to the Church)
