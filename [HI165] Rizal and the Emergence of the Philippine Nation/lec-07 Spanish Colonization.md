# Spanish Colonization

* Political
  * Old: Datu, Timagua, Maharlika, ALipin
  * 1565: Miguel Lopez de Legazpi 
    * After the failure of Magellan's expedition, many were sent to the Philippines. 
    * He established the first Christian settlements found in the PH and in Cebu (Colonial Areas)
    * Manila
    * They were able to create a lot of colonial administrations
    * Changed the political landscape of the Philippines. They saw that there were problems in the PH they were not anticipating
      * There was no gold
      * The PH is rich not in resources but in human resources, and tried to transform the PH into a labor market instead of a gold mining place
    * Tried to make the PH into what's known as the Spanish colonial administration

## Spanish Colonial Administration
* **Barangay Level**: Mayor-esque, local level
  * **Regular People**: 
  * **Cabeza de Barangay**: Also the Datu
  * **Datu/Gobernadorcillo**: 
    * Highest PH authority in the Philippines (He wanted to preserve the original structure)
    * Preserved to keep order and leadership in the PH community
    * Highest position of authority a Filipino can achieve in the Philippines
    * Still feels in control of the barangay or community, but is now large of a largeer bureaucratic system
* **Alcalde**: Governor-esque, provincial level
* **Governor General**: Military-esque, national level
  * Executive, Legislative and Judicial duties
  * First GG: Miguel Lopez de Legazpi
* **Royal Audiencia**: Supreme court, 
  * Higher than the GG despite being governed by the GG
  * Different office, but still controlled by one individual
* **Council of Indies**: International, regional level
  * Responsible for managing the different colonies of Spain (eg. Cuba, Mexico, all Latin-american countries except Brazil)
  * We are technically under Mexico because we did not generate anything
  * Reports to Spain
* **Spain**: Theocratic form of government
  * **King**
  * **Catholic Church**
* **Problem**
  * The problem and solution gets lost because of the number of people you have to pass the problem to
  * It takes the boat 6 months to get to Spain, 6 months to get to the PH, and months to deliver the message
  * "Obedezco pero no cumplo" 

## Three Goals in the PH
* Religion: How do you force the PH to accept Christianity at the same time forcing them into a civilization?
* Civilization: Accept the Western way of life
  * **Plaza Complex**: Forces them to live in western towns, stone houses, and create permanent residences
  * **Reduccion**: Resettlement - you have to remove all indios from the bahay kubos and move them all into western settlements, in order to make them part of the economic, bureaucratic and political structure
    * Plaza Complex: Religion, Westernize, Taxes (Pay off expenses for colonization efforts)
    * How do you force these indios to live in these houses?
      * **Fiestas**: 
        * We have 200 celebrations with different saints
        * Religious or national celebrations
        * Created to make establishments seem happy (used Banderitas)
      * **Gifts or Bribery** 
        * Men: Food w/o hunting, Weapons
        * Women: Mirrors (Vanity), Comb
      * **Security**
    * Effects on Filipinos
      * Left behind their pagan way of life (leaving all traditions behind because there's no room for them)
      * Extraction of Wealth: they were charged with high taxes in form of money or service
      * Property and Riches: they believed Filipinos built their houses to hide gold underneath
    * **Center of Reduccion** is the Church (all roads lead to the Church)

## Socio-Economic Aspects of Reduccion
* The Spanish created a commodity: I am teaching you the word of God, and in turn you have to pay me back
* Buwis / Tuibuto / Taxes = Only way they can replace the non existent gold in the Philippines
* **Ways of Extracting / Corrupt Practices**
  * **Creation of Names**: Where the Spanish created the Cedula
    * Residence identification, Location and Job
    * Indicates the amount of taxes you're paying, and you can no longer hide
    * **Problem:** Filipinos didn't have names, so they started giving Christian names
      * Catalogo Alfabetico de Apellidos by Narciso Claveria: List of all PH surnames paying taxes
  * **Polo y Servicio**: Forced Labour
    * 16 to 60 years old: Soldiers, Ship Builders, Farming
    * Mandatory exercise created by the Spanish to force everyone to work
    * They realised the taxes were not enough. After cedulas, they knew everyone's age so it's easier to keep track of them.
    * PH hated this practice: Working 3-6 months throughout the year = Agriculture suffers
    * Exceptions: The Datu/Maharlika class or those who can pay are usually exempted
  * **Bandala System**: Assigning of Animal Quotas
    * Specific products per province of the PH to be sold to the Spanish
    * eg. Pampanga's sisig, eggs, tapa
      * Spanish required Pampanga to produce 20,000-30,000 eggs per month for protein (demand for meat, but there was no meat)
    * eg. Bohol was also asked to produce eggs, not for consumption
      * Making the statues of disciples look whiter with a mixture made with egg shells
    * **How did this become a corrupt practice?** Spanish ended up not paying for products because they didn't have enough money
  * **Galleon Trade**
    * From realizing they had a continuous flow of money and taxes. They also had annual quotas, and realized they could profit from trade.
    * Existed from the beginning of the reduccions (1700's).
    * Lasted 250 years, Lifeline of the Phils [Only tether we had to the western world]
    * Spain => Mexico => PH => China [Manila-Acapulco Trade]
    * **What did we receive from Mexico**
      * Bahay Kubo: Vegetables that can be found are believed not to be indigenous from the PH (eg. Singkamas, Talong, Sigarilyas, Mani)
      * Chocolate/Tablea: Used as many reference points in Noli me Tangere and other notable writings
        * eg. Padre Damaso: Church had the monopoly of chocolate that time. If they don't like you, they serve chocolate evap (very thick). If they do, they serve chocolate agua (very mild, doesn't taste chocolate-y).
      * Tiangge/Bazaar
      * Horses = Tikbala
      * Tobacco
    * **What the PH sent in Galleon Trade**
      * Shells or Aquatic products
      * Alcoholic Beverages
      * Chinese Products
    * **Bodega**: Large compartment of the Galleon where PH worked as **bodegueros** to balance the cargo and smuggle goods
  * **Encomienda**
    * Came from the old Spanish techniques from fighting the Crusades (Conquistadors)
    * The PH had no gold; how will they pay the Conquistadors? => **Land**
    * Extract taxes from the locals
    * Imposed Catholicism
    * Diameter of Encomienda became bigger each year to "capture" people who did not want to be part of it
      * **Bayanihan**: Created to escape the encomienda practices
