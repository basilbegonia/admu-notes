  * Most pictures of Jose Rizal are always him wearing a coat

    * Talks about Land-Grabbing issue in the Philippines
      * When Rizal was in EU, the Dominicans were stealing the land of the Rizals and he couldn't do anything
      * Created a story that reflected that incident

## Idea of Revolution
* When Basilio was gonna get money buried in his mother's grave, he saw Simoun and they talked his backstory/plans of revolution
* They had nothing in common
* **Simoun's Plan for Revolution**
  * Be close to the governor general. Tell him to sequester lands and impose taxes, and create laws unfavorable to people (Remove all the posessions of people so they'd have nothing to fear)
    * *I have encouraged crime and cruelty to accustom the people to the thought of death. I fostered insecurity to drive them to seek the most desperate solutions. I cripplied business so that the country, impoverished and ruined, would no longer have anything to fear. I whetted appetites for public funds.*
  * Keep the ilustrados and principalia very wealthy
    * The poorest of the poor will notice the discrepancy between them getting bigger by the moment
  * Start the revolution by funding armed groups (supplying them with weapons and ammunition)
  * Blow up the house of Kapitan Tiyago
    * Organised a wedding party and invited the rich people to the house (poetic justice)
* **Basilio's Rebuttal**
  * *When I was about to achieve the spontaneous combustion of all this corruption, this loathsome accumulation of garbage, and when frenzied greed, taken unaware, was rushing about to seize whatever was at hand, like an old woman surprised by fire, you show up with your slogans of Pro-Hispanism*
  * Violence does not solve violence
  * *Only ambition is to alleviate the physical ills of my fellow citizens*
    * Simoun's retort: *You should save other sons from being mrudered, other mothers from being mad. Resignation is not always a virtue; it is a crime when it encourages oppression. There are no tyrants when there are no slaves.*
      * The reason we become slaves is becase we let them transform us in the manner (victims of our own crime)
    * *I do not mean to say that our freedom must be won at the point of the sword*
      * The sword no longer wields much influence on the destinies of our age; but I do not mean we must win our freedom by deserving it, improving the mind and enhancing the dignity of the individual, loving the just, the god, the great to the extent of dying for it.
    * *He refuses to envision the use of force and would seek his country's good "through education and progress"*
    * *Wrongs are not righted by other wrongs and for our misfortunes all of us have a share to blame*
* **Rizal remains confused**
  * Similar to Noli: doesn't provide a definitive answer
  * A window to Rizal's thinking about the revolution:
    * Peaceful revolution led by the Ilustrados
    * Violent revolution covered by venge and anger

## Rizal's Exile
* Was exiled to **Dapitan, Zamboanga** because he was seen as a troublemaker
* **Became a doctor**: **Josephine Bracken** (her father's eyesight was degrading)
  * Josephine Bracken had a miscarriage
    * Fell from the stairs from Rizal surprising her
    * She was looking towards the nearby forest, saw an animal and got startled (Rizal pretending to be the animal)
  * Fetus buried underneath Rizal's house at Dapitan
* **Became a teacher**
* **Became an adviser**
  * KKK
  * Dangerous to stay in Zamboanga because he'd be implicated: decided to go to Cuba and become a military doctor
  * Revolution started before he was able to leave
* **Got brought back to Intramuros, Manila**
