## Definition of History (Aug 12, 2015)
* **Study of the Past**: Large and Encompassing
  * Not all events in the past have history
* **Story**: Has characters, Plot and a Chronology
* **Recorded**: Who, What, Where, Why
  * Written: Diary of Anne Frank, Jose Rizal's Letters
  * Oral Tradition: Superstitions, Culture
  * Artifacts: Objects, Art, Monuments
    * eg. The Last Supper entails that the Renaissance is a rebirth of the classical ideas (painting style) coming from Romans, and Christianity was relevant.
    * eg. Rizal wearing a coat in his monuments because of European influence
* **Has a Value**: Kasaysayan - root word is Saysay, implies significance of value
* **Three Elements of History**
  * Time
  * Location/Space
  * Actors
* *Can History exist without people?* 
  * Study of history isn't about the actual event, but about the value or meaning of certain events to the lives of people
  * History is not the search of the truth, evidence or facts - it's the search of meaning or value of what we do
