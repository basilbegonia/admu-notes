## Definition of History (Aug 12, 2015)
* **Study of the Past**: Large and Encompassing
  * Not all events in the past have history
* **Story**: Has characters, Plot and a Chronology
* **Recorded**: Who, What, Where, Why
  * Written: Diary of Anne Frank, Jose Rizal's Letters
  * Oral Tradition: Superstitions, Culture
  * Artifacts: Objects, Art, Monuments
    * eg. The Last Supper entails that the Renaissance is a rebirth of the classical ideas (painting style) coming from Romans, and Christianity was relevant.
    * eg. Rizal wearing a coat in his monuments because of European influence
* **Has a Value**: Kasaysayan - root word is Saysay, implies significance of value
* **Three Elements of History**
  * Time
  * Location/Space
  * Actors
* *Can History exist without people?* 
  * Study of history isn't about the actual event, but about the value or meaning of certain events to the lives of people
  * History is not the search of the truth, evidence or facts - it's the search of meaning or value of what we do

## Geology (Aug. 17, 2015)
* **Map of the Philippines**
  * Archipelagic with 7107 islands
    * Bad: Created a sense of isolation - failed to create a unified order
    * Good: Hindered the expansion of the Spanish
  * Northernmost Point: **Batanes**
    * Houses are made of stone and not in stilts due to the occurrence of typhoons and cold weather (Closer to ground = Warmer)
    * Almost 0 Crime Rate
    * Very close to Taiwan
    * Honesty sari-sari store
  * Southernmost Point: Tawi-Tawi
  * Calinga: there are headhunters, halo-halo
  * Pampanga: they were forced to make delicacies
* **Myths/Legends**
  * Tatlong Princesa
    * Luz, Vi, Minda (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao)
    * Their dad was strict, they left to search for true love and the king transformed them to islands to punish them
  * Two giants (one in the sky, one in the sea) throwing rocks at each other
  * Battle between Sky and Sea thanks to a bird that pissed the sea off
    * Bird flying in the air, he had no place to land
    * Decided to make the sea and sky fight each other
    * Sea tried to attack the sky by throwing waves at it, sky threw stones at it
    * The stones are the islands of the Phils
* **Science**
  * Sea
    * Fossilized remains of aquatic life on PH terrain
    * Land came from volcanic activity
  * Part of Mainland Asia
    * Fits perfectly to the contours of Vietnam
  * Land Bridges
    * Islands used to be connected but water rose and removed the bridges (least likely)
    * Created a sense of isolation: became very detrimental and advantageous (Spanish had a hard time colonizing the whole philippines)
