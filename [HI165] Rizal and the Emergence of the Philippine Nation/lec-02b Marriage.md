# Marriage

## Marriage
* In general, ancient Filipinos were monogamous although polygamy was practiced in many places. This is confirmed by Chrinio's account, in which he denied having observed polygamous marriages in Manila, Mindoro, Marinduque, and Panay
* In many areas of Bisayas a man was expected to have only one wife although there was no stringent prohibition against having more than one provided the person was a **wealthy man**.
  * Implied marriage was an economic concept
* **Polygamy** was applicable not only to men, but also to women
  * As a Husband,
    * First Wife is the legal and most powerful
      * Has the greatest estate to the husband's wealth in the event of his death.
    * Second Wife is the Ka-ibig, everything else is a Kaibigan
      * Focused more on sexual passion
* The Philippines is a patriarchal society, but only on the economic aspects
  * Women are still in charge of religion

## Wedding and Courtship
* Most of the courtship and relationships in the barangay are for economic reasons
* If a man likes a woman, he doesn't talk to her, but follows her and talks to her father so that he can court her
  * If the father agrees, he needs to pay his father (swords, cattle, boat, anything useful for the family)
  * When the family starts using the payment, then the courtship can happen
  * If the woman doesn't like the man then the courtship ends and the family needs to return the item
    * But if the family realizes that they cannot live without the item, the woman will be compelled to marry the man
* **MamanHikan**
  * Introducing families to each other, very disrespectful if skipped
  * Way for the husband to introduce his parents to the family of the bride (Transaction)

## Dowry
* Most early writers described dowry as bride purchase or bride price. Phelan however suggests that the bride service and the dowry complex were connected with the prospects of **providing bride money for the son's marriage** and not with the idea of compensating the family of the bridge for all the troubles the parents underwent in bringing her up.
* **Reasons for the Bride Price**
  * Compensation: Family of the Bride
    * It takes a lot of money to raise a child, and the loss of the daughter costs a lot of money
    * Money they are compensating is for the rearing of the marriage
  * Payment of future marriages/transactions for their son
    * Form of Investment
    * If you have a brother, he also needs to pay another family a bride price
  * Loss of Work/Labor
    * Daughter leaves the family, and she is doing certain jobs for the family (Household Chores)
    * The son needs to compensate for the loss of work
* **Ways of Extracting**
  * When the couple dances after marriage rituals
    * Attaching money to the bride and groom
    * When a family attaches a bigger amount of money, the other family has to top the amount
    * Pre-Colonial: Bride and Groom are tossed money until they stop dancing
    * "Nagpakasal ka, pero wala kang pera" Further states that marriage is an economic transaction
  * Bribing family members to leave so the couple will be left alone
  * Answer riddles, and move one step forward if answered correctly
    * Answering the riddles = street smart = rich
    * The chosen one will bring his family and his family members will be asked questions
  * Man becomes an alipin until the family is satisfied
    
## Divorce
* If divorce happens and the union of marriage was cut, then all the money paid by the groom will be returned by the wife's family (with interest)
* More of an economic process rather than love
  * Explains why families usually intervene in marriages
  * "Understand your husband"
  * The family is always somewhat there to solve the problems of the husband [because it's economic]

## Customs and Beliefs
* Apparently the custom of the groom working for the family of the prospective bride was prevalent in pre-conquest days as it is still in practice in mary rural areas of the Philippines
* **Sukob**: Sisters cannot get married on the same year
* Barangay shut down because they want to celebrate marriages
* Having children was the norm
* Arranged marriages were common
  * If the bride is bad and trashy, you don't need to pay the dowry
  * It should be an honor for someone to want to marry you
* **Many Children**: In the PH, the more children you have, the better
  * Practices to follow when pregnant: twin bananas, etc
