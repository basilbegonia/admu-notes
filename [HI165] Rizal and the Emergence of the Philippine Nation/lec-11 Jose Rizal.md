# Jose Rizal

## Background Information
* June 19, 1861
* Calamba, Laguna
* Don Francisco Mercado and Dona Teodora Alonso
  * Mercado: Very wealthy Filipino, owned a lot of businesses and land
  * Alonso: Spanish (Middle Class), Speaks 3 languages (Spanish&English: Sign of Wealth)
  * Very learned and wealthy

## Ferdinand Blumentritt
* Fascinated by the Philippines
* Talked to Rizal and wrote extensively
  * "I am the only Rizal at home, everyone else has preferred our old surname Mercado"
  * "There were a lot of Mercado's in the PH not related to us, and a **provincial governor** who was a friend of the family added Rizal to our name"
  * Wanted a name for protection
  * **Rizal**: Green fields
* Rizal to Blumentritt:
  * After the sad catastrophe [**1872: Cavite Mutiny**]
    * Resulted in a witch hunt
  * Paciano [Rizal's older brother] had to leave the university because he was liberal and disliked by the friars for living in the same house as **Burgos**
  * I had to go to school in MNL at that time, and he advised me to use our second surname, Rizal, to avoid difficulties in our studies.
* Rizal to Blumentritt:
  * Rizal wanted to go to Manila to study at 16, but his mother did not want to
  * Our youth should not apply themselves to love or to the mechanical or speculative science [medicine]; that is for the youth of the nation's that are happy
  * We for our part must sacrifice something for politics even against our desire
    * Still evident today: people failing in industries going into politics
* **Paciano to Rizal**:
  * Paciano had a strong influence on Jose Rizal: Served as a second father to him, interested in the same things
  * I do not think that the study of **law** will suit you but rather the arts; in this I am sure of the same view as our parish priest, and really a lawyer here is a landlord, teacher, farmer, contractor, that's to say, everything but a lawyer
    * Crossroads for Rizal
  * While there are few who **practice medicine** and the arts, they make **progress**, here and they live **peacefully**, the one thing we should look for in this world.
    * Progress and Peace:  Goals in life
  * Written in the 19th Century:
    * As early as the 19th century, families are already focusing on two jobs: Lawyer and Doctor

* **Sa Aking Kababata**
  * Attributed to Rizal to make him seem like a national hero
  * Bayan/Community: Concept did not exist then
  * Questions the validity of Jose Rizal
* **Garotte**
  * Medieval Torture Device
  * Either pushes a needle through the back of your neck or your head twists
  * Execution of the GOMBURZA
* **Lived in the outskirts of Madrid**
  * Bought bath, candles, matches and laundry service: implied the lack of his facilities to do them himself
* **Odly enough it would appear that, contrary to the **general assumption, he never got his doctorate in medicine** although he took and passed the course in the history of medicine, surgical analysis and normal histology 1884-1885. He never submitted his doctoral thesis, and was only issued a licentiate degree.

**Elias**: Pays so much defence to Ibarra, not simple gratitude (What is his motive?)
