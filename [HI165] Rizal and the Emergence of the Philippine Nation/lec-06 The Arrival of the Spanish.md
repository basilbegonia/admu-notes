# The Arrival of the Spanish

* Search for China and Spice Islands
* **Ferdinand Magellan**: Portuguese Explorer, Chronicler Antonio Pigafetta
* Magellan sighted the mountains of what is now Samar while on a mission to find a westward route to the Moluccas Islands for Spain. With 150 crew left, members of his expedition became the first Spaniards to reach the Philippine archipelago
  * There were rumors of Dutch arriving in the PH: unsubstantiated and undocumented
* What happened when they arrived in the PH?
  * After several years of crossing in the pacific ocean (went below South America), he arrived in Samar

## Pigafetta's Account
* There, Magellan befriended Rajah Kulambu and Rajah Siagu, the chieftain of Limasawa, who guided him to Cebu. He and his queen were baptised in to Catholic faith
  * Conquistadors aim for religious and military conquest
* Magellan baptised Rajah Humabon and Hara Amihan as Christians, and gave them an image of a santo nino and a cross. 
  * We killed Magellan and we're proud of killing him, but we want to preserve his cross
  * When Magellan died, chances are they would've destroyed the cross
* As a result of MAgellan's influence with Rajah Humabon, an order had been issued to the nearby chiefs to provide food supplies for chiefs and to convert to Christianity
  * Pigafetta showed Filipinos as welcome to religion and "desire" to be converted
  * We are accepting this type of religion because we saw it as a means of trade
* However, Datu Lapu-Lapu (Mactan) is the only chieftain to show his opposition. He refused to accept the authority of Rajah Humabon in these matters.
  * A fish decided to attack Magellan and Lapu-Lapu decided to give it his name
  * This opposition proved to be influential when Pigafetta writes [the account with Zula]

* Divide and conquer; used Magellan as a means to end their rivalry. 
* [In Mactan] They believed Magellan was there to capture them. Filipinos assembled in large numbers, and ran towards them + throwing things. They were firing so many things but uselessly. The main goal is to stop them from chasing us
* No mention of the Spanish getting hit
* Magellan tried to scare them off by burning some houses in what is now Buaya, known then as Bulaia. They were infuriated because they realised the goal of the Spaniards was not only to capture them, but to terrorise them. At this time, Pigafetta was at the shore.
  * It would have been impossible for him to see the close details occurring from the distance.
  * How did he know the captain was shot with a poison arrow?
  * "The mortars in the boat were too far away."
* Very romanticised view of the accounts of Pigafetta (eg. Magellan turning back to look at boats)
  * There are no records of Filipinos fighting up close or Lapu-Lapu having a sword or actually being in the fight or decapitation (so many accounts are interpretations that cannot happen in reality)

## Sir's Interpretation
* On the morning of the battle, Magellan's ship were grounded and could not come closer. They were unable to use their artillery (Magellan's first mistake)
* They rode smaller boats to reach the destination. Mactan's shores have a lot of sandbars. They rode and pushed the boat many times whenever they reached what resembled land.
* When they reached shore, their guns would not fire properly (from getting wet), and they had to bring in more supplies.
* The Filipinos were running and screaming towards them, but Magellan's forces stood their ground. They each formed 3 divisions. The fight was so far that they ended up not hitting each other (cowardly fight)
* Magellan decided to burn their houses, which made the Filipinos very angry. They realised that the soldiers were protecting Magellan, and realised he was the leader.
  * No one protected the houses because they wanted to stick together in fear of getting kidnapped.
* Magellan was defeated, and his forces started to retreat back to Spain to complete the expedition of circumnavigating the globe.
