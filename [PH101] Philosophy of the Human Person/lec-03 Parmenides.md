# Parmenides

* **Parmenides**: Pre-Socrates Philosophy
  * May nararanasang espesyal na hindi masabi-sabi at pinapakita sa pamamagitan ng talinhaga
  * Methodos: 
* **Herakleitos**: Pilosopong gumagawa ng reaksyon kay Parmenides
  * Sinusubukang intindihin logos
    * May kung-anumang kwan/enerhiyang patuloy na iniipon ang lahat at sinusubukang manatili ang lahat upang hindi sumabog ang lahat
    * Ipunin ang lahat upang manatili
    * Noong panahon ng mga Griyego, ang pinakadominanteng pandama ay ang **pagkikinig**
      * Mahirap dahil ikaw lang ang nag-aabang (vs. seeing where you can always look or turn away)
      * Hidwaan (Tension): binubuo ng logos (eg. Bow&Arrow, Guitar, kailangan ng tamang timpla)
  * No one steps on the same river twice: The river flows before you get to step on it twice (Patuloy na paggalaw at pagbabago)
* **Tula ni Parmenides**
  * Gustong malaman ang kabuuan ng **meron**
    * Talagang nangyayari
    * Talagang totoo
    * Talagang nangyayari at talagang totoo at kahit na isipin ko na hindi nangyayari ay nangyayari pa rin
    * Hindi lamang bagay; patuloy na pangyayari (not just a noun, also a verb - mismong akto ng pag-iral)
  * **Entheos**: "Sinasakyan ka ng Diyos", inspired, latin inspiritus
  * **First Part**
    * Back then, Greeks focused on politics. Countries didn't exist, just governments with their own ways of life and beliefs. Societies were patriarchal and women mostly did housework.
    * Horses were female because 'may kagalingan panghawakan ng kababaihan ang katotohanan'
    * Female daimon (mga anak ng diyos) riding the horse
      * Eudaimonia: Kaligayahan
  * **Second Part**
    * Alamat yung lugar: May kung anumang importante nangyari doon
    * Dumadaan doon ang mga lalaking may alam sa mga siyudad

  1.1 The mares which carry me as far as my spirit ever aspired
  1.2 were escorting me, when they brought me and proceeded along the renowned road
  1.3 of the goddess, which brings a knowing mortal to all cities one by one.
  1.4 On this path I was being brought, on it wise mares were bringing me,
  1.5 straining the chariot, and maidens were guiding the way. 

  1.6 The axle in the center of the wheel was shrilling forth the bright sound of a musical pipe,
  1.7 ablaze, for it was being driven forward by two rounded
  1.8 wheels at either end, as the daughters of the Sun,
  1.9 were hastening to escort after leaving the house of Night for the light,
  1.10 having pushed back the veils from their heads with their hands. 

  1.11 There are the gates of the roads of Night and Day,
  1.12 and a lintel and a stone threshold contain them.
  1.13 High in the sky they are filled by huge doors
  1.14 of which avenging Justice holds the keys that fit them.
  1.15 The maidens beguiled her with soft words

  1.16 and skillfully persuaded her to push back the bar for them
  1.17 Quickly from the gates. They made
  1.18 a gaping gap of the doors when they opened them,
  1.19 swinging in turn in their sockets the bronze posts
  1.20 fastened with bolts and rivets. There, straight through them then,

  1.21 the maidens held the chariot and horses on the broad road.
  1.22 And the goddess received me kindly, took my right hand in hers,
  1.23 and addressed me with these words:
  1.24 'Young man, accompanied by immortal charioteers,
  1.25 who reach my house by the horses which bring you, 

  1.26 welcome - since it was not an evil destiny that sent you forth to travel
  1.27 this road (for indeed it is far from the beaten path of humans),
  1.28 but Right and justice. There is need for you to learn all things - 
  1.29 both the unshaken heart of persuasive Truth
  1.30 and the opinions of mortals, in which there is no true reliance.
  1.31 But nevertheless you will learn these too - that the things that appear
  1.32 must genuinely be, being always, indeed, all things.

  My philosophical and poetic inspiration, my imagination and my intelligence, which are able to bring, as fast mares, my mind until where my heart desires, led me to the way, which belongs to the deity, which leads the man who knows and who researches knowledge to know everything.
  ￼￼￼￼￼￼
  My inspiration took me, and the maidens, daughters of the Sun, illuminated my path of rational search for Truth.
  They took me from the houses of the Night and of human ignorance into the light of the Day and of divine knowledge. They guided me to the giant gate that divides the paths of Night and Day;
  Divine Law that governs the world holds the keys of the gate.
  The maidens, daughters of the Sun, convinced that divine guardian of the gate to open it for us: so I could access the divine knowledge.
  The Queen of the Gods greeted me kindly and so told me:
  Oh young man, who – led by inspiration and by the light of knowledge –
  reach our house, rejoice, because not a bad fate
  has sent you to follow this path (it is in fact out of the path of men),
  but divine will and justice.
  It is necessary that you learn all things,
  both the Truth known only by the Gods
  and the opinions of mortals, always deceptive;
  you also need how to interpret the appearances
  that continuously pass before the eyes of mortals.
