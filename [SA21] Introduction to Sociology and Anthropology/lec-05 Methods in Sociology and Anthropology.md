# Methods in Sociology and Anthropology
* Sociology: Quantitative, Anthropology: Qualitative

## How do social scientists see the world?
* Social research offers a powerful process to help you
  * Make decisions (eg. What type of person should you marry?)
  * Understand events in the larger world around you (eg. Why do students do shootings?)
  * Decide professional issues (eg. Which product is likely to sell the most?)
* **Critical Thinking**: Intense awareness that leads to discernment by not accepting just anything that comes along
  * Gambler's Fallacy: Something will happen after a long time of it not happening
  * Attribution Error: Blaming negative outcomes to other sources, attributing positive ones to ourselves
  * eg. INC Rally: People not knowing what they're protesting for
* **Social Research**:
  * Uses critical thinking as part of our arguments (logically connected statements with a clear conclusion)
  * Based on systematic empirical evidence
* **Evidence**
  * Quantitative and Qualitative
  * Create a situation, have a control group, measure and analyze reactions
* **Types of Social Research**
  * Four major purposes: Exploring, Describing, Explaining, Evaluating
* **The Research Process in 8 Steps**
  * Select a topic
  * Narrow the topic, or focus it on a specific research question. Define your hypothesis.
  * 
  * Develop a detailed plan on how to carry out the study. Decide on research techniques to use
  * Mixing the mind and the heart by studying human beings w/the same characteristics as us
  * Collection of data
  * Data analysis (Look for trends, patterns, etc)
  * Interpretation of analyzed data
  * Prepare a report
  * **Quantitative Research**
    * Fine tune the research question or problem
    * Decide your 'universe'
    * Research path to follow (linear path: fixed sequence of steps in one direction)
    * Examining variables (independent, dependent, intervening)
    * Hypothesis
    * Looking for patterns
    * Explain what we've found
      * Causal explanation has three elements:
        * Time order: Cause must come earlier in time than the effect
        * Association: Cause and effect are associated or they go together and vary with one another
        * Alternative causes ruled out: There is no better or stronger cause than the one you identified.
      * **Qualitative Research**
        * 1. Fine tunt topic
        * 2. Identify the specific area where yo  
        * 3. Researcy Path (psiral path: going back to the need as much as you need to)
        * 4. Examining cases (Case studies)
          * Direct observation
          * Participant observation
          *Key informants: Conduct semi-structured interviews to record insiders' understanding of the events under the study
        * 5. Patterns (compare data)
