# Anthropology

## Anthropological Theories
* **Evolutionism**
  * **Edward Burnet Tylor**: Classical deifnition of culture and proposed it as a topic that can be studied scientifically
  * **Lewis Morgan**: Assumed human society was linear and evolved through lower, middle and upper savagery and barbarism, and civilization [unilineal evolutionism]
* **The Boasians**
  * **Franz Boas**: Each culture, despite similar totems, have different meanings associated with them due to differing sociological and geographical contexts [historical particularism]
* **Functionalist**
  * **Bronislaw Malinowski**:

* Anthropology helps us study societies as they exist today rather than across time
* Structural Functionalism: Customs function to preserve social structure.

* **Configurationalism**
  * Ruth Benedict and Margaret Merd
  * Related to functionalism in the sense that culture is seen as integrated
  * Culture traits and whole cultures are uniquely patterned or integrated 
    * Borrowed traits (diffision) are indigenized and modified to fit the existing culture
* **Neoevolutionism**
  * Leslie White, Julian Steward
  * Cultures might not evolve in the same direction (multilinear evolutionism)
* **Cultural Materialism**
  * Marvin Harris
  * All societies consist of:
    * **Infrastructure**: Base consisting of technology, economics and demography [systems of production and reproduction without which societies cannot survive]
    * **Structure**: Growing out of infrastructure is structure: Social relations, forms of kinship and descent, patterns of distribution and consumption
    * **Superstructure**: Religion, ideology and play-aspects of culture furthest away from the meat and bones that enable cultures to survive
  * **Key Belief (White, Steward, Marx)**: In the final analysis, infrastructure determines structure and superstructure

## Processual Approaches to Culture
* **Agency**
  * Interplay between culture and individual people
  * Our capacity to act within a particular context [culture is not a fixed set of practices functioning as permanent social glue]
  * Agency: Actions we take both alone and in groups, in forming and transforming cultural identities
* **Practice Theory**
  * Individuals in society have diverse motives and intentions as well as different degrees of power and influence
  * Focuses on how such varied individuals - through their actions and practices - induce and transform the world they live in
  * Reciprocal relation between culture and individual
* **
