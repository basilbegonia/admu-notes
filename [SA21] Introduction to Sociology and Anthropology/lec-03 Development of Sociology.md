# Sociology

## The Development of Sociology
* Before the mid-1800's, the study of society was the domain of social philosophers
  * They concentrated on the idealism of society than what society actually is like
* **Origin**: Mid-19th Century industrial revolution in Europe
  * The rapid social transformation needed to be analyzed and explained, and the direction of change was unclear
  * eg. The culture of close knit communities disappeared, the different classes arose, scientific revolution/enlightenment: religion started becoming irrelevant
  * Within this context, sociology began to emerge as people decided to study society in a more objective way
    * Natural Sciences: Can we apply their methologies to society?
    * Exposure of Europeans to other continents: Culture shock

## Early Sociologists
* Usually both philosophers and sociologists
* **Auguste Comte**
  * Coined the term sociology
  * Two specific problems for sociological investigation
    * Social Statics: Problem of order or stability (How and why do societies hold together?)
    * Social Dynamics: Social Change (What shapes the nature and direction of society?)
* **Herbert Spencer**
  * Compared human societies to living 
  * Various stabilities of society that're interdependent work on the stability of society as a whole
  * Answer to Social Change: Theory of evolution
* **Karl Marx**
  * Marxism =/= Communism: Marx aimed to overthrow ruling exploiters
  * Social Conflict leads to revolution
  * Social harmony was the necessary condition for progress
  * Problem of **Social Order**:
    * Societies are held together by the shared beliefs&values, through religious doctrine and ritual
    * Religion as the "opium of the people": Preventing people from emancipating themselves from things they dislike (Controlling Society)
  * **Breakthough**: Individual issues are intertwined with social issues [Study of Suicide]
* **Max Weber**
  * Debate with the ghost of Marx
  * The trend towards greater social equality was inevitable [but he didn't like it bec it'd put the state over the individual]
    * Not always traced to Economy (Marx), as other factors (eg. Religion) can also play a roal
* **Sociologists** should aim at the goal of value-freedom (no biases) in their professional work

## Modern Developments
* **George Herbert Mead**: Social Psychology
* **Robert Park and Ernest Burgess**: Social Problems and Lives of criminals, drug addicts, prostitutes and juvenile delinquents
* Trend: perfecting research methods and statistical techniques to the detriment of the earlier activist strain

* **The Functionalist Perspective**
  * Society will have functions, a social system that has functions
  * Organized, stable and well-integrated wherein members agree on basic values
    * eg. Family functions to regulate sexual behaviour, to transmit social values to children and to take care of young&aged people.
  * Social change is disruptive unless it takes place relatively slowly
  * Functions and Dysfunctions: Positive and Negative Consequences, regardless of purposes
  * **Robert Merton**:
    * Manifest Function: What's intended, direct goal or purpose of an institution, obvious and intended consequence
    * Latent Function: An unrecognized and unintended consequence that's still positive
    * eg. Going to school, learning=manifest, making friends=latent
  * Sometimes an event can be functional in one respect and dysfunctional in another
    * eg. Industry: Society's way of life vs Environment, Marcos
* **Conflict Perspective**
  * View of society that focuses on processes of tension, competiwtion and change
  * **Karl Marx** saw the struggle between social classes as the main force of change
  * Modern conflict is seen among many groups and interests as a fact of life in any society (eg. Generation Gaps)
    * Cannot be imposed by "Order and Stability" or merely conforming
    * Not necessarily outright violence - also refers to tension, hostility, competition and disagreement over goals and values
  * Sees constant change as a permanent feature
  * Who Benefits?
    * **Social Inequality**: It's not functional for society as a whole, but it allows people to achieve political/economic power and pass these advantages to their descendants
    * Social processes cannot be fully understood without referring to this conflict of interest, a conflict whose outcome always favors the stronger party.
      * eg. People Power, Cory Aquino had power and helped out the masses - leveled their odds in going against Marcos
  * **Advantages**: Highlights aspect of society that the functionalist perspective tends to ignore
  * **Disadvantages**: Focuses on issues of competition and change, while failing to take into account more orderly, stable and less controversial dimensions of social reality.
* **Interactionist Perspective**
  * Does not necessarily contest the previous 2
  * A view of society that focuses on the way in which people act toward, respond to and influence one another.
  * **Max Weber**: Importance of understanding the social world from the viewpoint of the individuals who act within it.
  * Focuses on everyday social interaction
  * Gives life to abstract concepts such as "the economy" or "the state" (eg. Stock Market not acting by itself)
    * Therefore, it is through social behaviour that society can come into being
    * Society is ultimately created, maintained and changed by the social interaction of its members
  * **Erving Goffman**
    * Dramaturgical approach to social interaction [We are all actors]
    * People play different roles and 'stage-manage' their lives and the impressions they create on others
  * **George Homans**: Exchange approach to social interaction; We constantly reward or punish people around us
  * **Harold Garfinkel**: An attempt to scrape below the surface of social behaviour to find out how people create and share their understandings of social life
  * **Mead and Blumer**
    * Symbolic Interactions; interaction that takes place through symbols eg. Signs, gestures, shared rules, written+spoken language
    * People do not respond to the world directly, as they place social meanings in things and respond to them (eg. red light in traffic means stop)
  * **Advantage**: Fascinating insight on mechanics of everyday life and reveals fundamental social processes that others easily overlook
  * **Disadvantages**: Neglects larger social institutions and processes of stability and change
