# Introduction

## Date Exercise Discussion
* **Deviance**: Doing things differently from the norm that usually ends up surprising people
  * What's deviant today may become the norm at another time
  * Socially transmitted
  * What seems to be individual is actually socially shared; we think we are 100% free but we actually end up doing things because of how society perceives them

## The Sociological Perspective
* **Perspective**: Not an absolute science; more open minded than closed books with theories that cannot change
* **What does it mean to be human?**
  * We share in the animal world, but there's something about being human that differentiates us from animals
  * Human beings are fully **self-aware**, capable of inquiring and reflecting about themselves
  * **Fundamental Existential Questions**
    * We share the same questions, but have different ways of answering them
    * *Why do human beings form families?*: There's a variety of family types, but they're always formed either way
    * *Why do people worship gods?*: We do not see other animals worship gods
    * *Why is the way of life of one group so different from another?*: What created the similarities and differences
    * *What makes some people break social rules while others obey them?*: Social Control and Deviance
    * *Why are some people rich while others are poor?*: Social Inequality, and how the Capitalist system cannot function without poverty
    * *What makes one group go into war with another?*
    * *What might a human being who had not been raised in the company of other people be like?*: Socialization and Social Interactions
    * *What holds society together?*
    * *Why do all societies continually change over time?*
  * **Previous ways of answering relied on:**: Intuition, Speculation, Myths, Superstitions
  * **In what ways can we apply sociology and anthropology in our daily lives?**
    * Helps us look at phenomena or events in a different way
* **Sociology as a Perspective**
  * The world does not consist of a reality that everyone sees in the same way
  * The sociological perspective invites us to look at our familiar surroundings as if for the first time
  * **Peter Berger**: Sociology is nothing less than a special form of consciousness
  * Sociology gives us a window on the wider world that lies beyond our immediate consciousness
    * World of the rich and powerful, World of the poor and weak, World of politicians, doctors etc..
  * Sociology enables us to appreciate view points other than our own, understand how they came into being, and better understand our attitudes, ourselves and our own lives
* **Basic Insight of Sociology**
  * eg. Symbolism of Cockfighting: Physically, the cocks are fighting; symbolically, it's their owners
  * **Sociological Premise**: We are social animals, otherwise we could not survive
  * **Basic Insight of Sociology**: Human behaviour is largely shaped by the groups to which people belong and by the social interaction that takes place within those groups
  * **Physical Sciences**: Physical laws are given and natural; humans do research to understand how they function as well as develop technologies that manipulate these given physical causes and effects
  * The sociological perspective enables us to see society not as something to be taken for granted as 'natural', but as a **tempirary social product**
    * Created by human beings, therefore capable of being changed by them as well (Social Reality is produced by Social Beings, and therefore can be modified and changed)
  * **Main Focus of Sociology**: 
    * Focus on the group rather than the individual
    * Interested in social itneraction
    * All social behavior and instituions are ultimately the product of social itneractions
    * The group provides the sociologist's main frame of reference
  * **How is sociology different from psychology?**
    * Psychology: Examines individuals
    * Social Psychology: How context affects the person
    * Sociology: Social Groups
      * Sociology is everything around you (People, Race/Gender/Ethnicity, Family, Knowledge, Stigmas/Racism, Common Culture), as everything that touches humanity is a part of society.
    * Anthropology: Microstudies or small parts that make up Sociologykkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
