## Deviance
* To refer to any violation of laws
  * Minor (Driving above the speed limit) and Major (Murder)
* Not the act itself, but the reactions and implications of it
* Symbolic Interactionist: Relativity of deviance
  * Different groups have different norms
* Sociologists use the term deviance non-judgmentally: an act to which people respond negatively
  * Erving Goffman: used the term "stigma" to refer to characteristics that discredit people
* **Control Theory**: Walter Reckless
  * Two control systems: inner control and outer controls - working against our tendencies to deviate
  * **Inner Control**: Internalised morality (conscience, ideas of right and wrong), internalised fears (punishment, shame, desire to be a good person)
  * **Outer Control**: Consists of people who influence us not to deviate (family, friends, police)
* **Labeling Theory**: Labels people are given affect their own and others' perceptions of them, thus channeling their behaviour into either deviance or conformity. There are 5 techniques to neutralise the accusations:
  * Denial of Responsibility: I am not responsible because..
  * Denial of Injury: No one got hurt!
  * Denial of a Victim: I'm the real victim (vengeance)
  * Condemnation of Condemners: Who do they think they are? Hypocrites!
  * Appeal to Higher Loyalties: I had to defend my family

* Deviance promotes social unity
  * The punishment of deviants fosters a "we" feeling among the group's members
* Deviance promotes social change
  * Boundary violations that gain enough support become new, acceptable behaviours
  * Deviance, then, may force a group to rethink and redifine its moral tendencies
* RE Homosexuality: "Who am I to judge them?"
