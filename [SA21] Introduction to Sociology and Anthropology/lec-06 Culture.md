# Culture

## Definition of Culture
* [Edward Tyler] Culture is equated to civilization. Culture is a complex whole which includes, belief, art, knowledge and any other capabilities and habits **acquired** (not inscribed in our DNA's or in a natural way) by man as a member of society.
* [Clifford Geertz] Culture is made up of symbols, motivations, moods and thoughts (Interpretivists) that are actively shared.
  * Cultural patterns are not reified or metaphysical, but things of this world.
  * Thick Description: eg. UAAP, Ateneo vs La Salle; it's more than just a basketball fight among players
  * Repetition of behaviours becomes a routine
    * But in the modern context, we just end up following without having to repeat

  * Ability to enhance the stability or solidarity of a social system [refresh workers]
  * Ability to transmit images, values and norms that legitimise existing patterns of thought and action [keeps the sytem in place, does not challenge]
  * Creativity still within social order
* **Conflict Perspective**
  * Popular culture is not created by the populace
  * Are actors of popular culture "free" or are they simply representing producst wanted be gatekeeprs/owners/powerful people? Is there such a thing as real genuine creativity?

* **Ideological Hegemony**
  * Control over cultural objects and symbols
  * Since they [the powerful] control the educational system, religious institutions and mass media, their view of the world becomes accepted as truth.
  * Owner of mass media is invisible
