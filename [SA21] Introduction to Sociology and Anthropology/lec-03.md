## The Development of Sociology
* Before the mid-1800's, the study of society was the domain of social philosophers
  * They concentrated on the idealism of society than what society actually is like
* **Origin**: Mid-19th Century industrial revolution in Europe
  * The rapid social transformation needed to be analyzed and explained, and the direction of change was unclear
  * eg. The culture of close knit communities disappeared, the different classes arose, scientific revolution/enlightenment: religion started becoming irrelevant
  * Within this context, sociology began to emerge as people decided to study society in a more objective way
    * Natural Sciences: Can we apply their methologies to society?
    * Exposure of Europeans to other continents: Culture shock

## Early Sociologists
* Usually both philosophers and sociologists
* **Auguste Comte**
  * Coined the term sociology
  * Two specific problems for sociological investigation
    * Social Statics: Problem of order or stability (How and why do societies hold together?)
    * Social Dynamics: Social Change (What shapes the nature and direction of society?)
* **Herbert Spencer**
  * Compared human societies to living 
  * Various stabilities of society that're interdependent work on the stability of society as a whole
  * Answer to Social Change: Theory of evolution
* **Karl Marx**
  * Marxism =/= Communism: Marx aimed to overthrow ruling exploiters
  * Social Conflict leads to revolution
  * Social harmony was the necessary condition for progress
  * Problem of **Social Order**:
    * Societies are held together by the shared beliefs&values, through religious doctrine and ritual
    * Religion as the "opium of the people": Preventing people from emancipating themselves from things they dislike (Controlling Society)
  * **Breakthough**: Individual issues are intertwined with social issues [Study of Suicide]
* **Max Weber**
  * Debate with the ghost of Marx
  * The trend towards greater social equality was inevitable [but he didn't like it bec it'd put the state over the individual]
    * Not always traced to Economy (Marx), as other factors (eg. Religion) can also play a roal
* **Sociologists** should aim at the goal of value-freedom (no biases) in their professional work

## Modern Developments
* **George Herbert Mead**: Social Psychology
* **Robert Park and Ernest Burgess**: Social Problems and Lives of criminals, drug addicts, prostitutes and juvenile delinquents
