# The Anthropological Perspectice

## Human Adaptability
* **Anthropology** is the exploration of human diversity in time and space
* Particular interest => the diversity that comes through human adaptability
* Creativity, adaptability and flexibility are basic human attributes, and human diversity is the subject matter of anthropology.
* Anthropology is a uniquely *comparative* and *holistic* science.
  * Sociology tries to go to the bigger picture right away
* People share **society** - organized life in groups - with other animals (baboons, wolves, ants, bees, etc). **Culture**, however, is distinctly human
* **Cultures** are traditions and customs, transmitted through learning, that form and guide the beliefs and behavior of people
* Europe: Anthropology is understood only as sociocultural
* America: Connections among the four fields
* Cultural and archelogical anthropologists study changes in social life and customs
* Archeologists try to establish how life might have been in the past
* Biological anthropologists examine evolutionary changes in physical forms
* Linguistic anthropologists reconstruct the basic of ancient languages by studying modern ones
* Language allows culture to act out, while culture informs language on what metaphors to use - cannot have one without the other 
* Anthropology: It's important to learn what culture is about before calling it weird (eg. Nipa Hut thing)
* **Traditions (Part of Culture) answer questions such as:**
  * How should we do things?
  * How do we make sense of the world?
  * How do we tell right from wrong?
  * What is right and what is wrong?
* A **culture** produces a degree of consistency in behavior and thought among people who live in a particular society
* Critical element of cultural traditions => Transmission through learning rather than through biological inheritance
* Culture does rest on certain biological features such as our ability to learn, think symbolically, use language, and employ tools
* Constant mutual interaction between culture and biology
* Biology is the material base that allows human beings to create cultures
* Cultures shape the way human beings want their physical appearances to be, affecting the biological constitution of people
  * eg. Event that starts repeating itself (Ritual, Ceremonies, Cultural)
* Human nature has a way of adapting because of survival

## Adaptation, Variation and Change
* Adaptation => The process by which organisms with environmental forces and stresses, such as those posed by climate and topographic or terrains
* For millions of years, hunting aand gathering were sole services of human experiencc
* Food production: cultivation of plants and domesticaion of animals: 12k to 10k years ago
* BEtween 600 and 5000 BC: First civilizations
*Tas

## General Anthropology
* Explores the basics of human biology, society, and culture along with their **interrelations**.
* Consists of four fields
  * Archeology
  * Biological
  * Social
*Cultural traditions promote certain activities and abilities, discouraging others and set standards of physical well-being and attractiveness
  * These physical practices, influenced by culture, helped build the body
  * Eg. Swimmers develop hard bodies, but Brazilian culture says women should be soft with big hips and buttocks, not shoulders
  * Hence, many young female swimmers in BRazil choose to abandon the sport rather than the 'feminine' body ideal

## Subdisciplines of Anthropology
* **Cultural Anthropology**: Study of human society and culture, describes, analyzes and explains social and cultural similarities and differences
  * Engage in two kinds of activities:
    * **Ethnography**: Based on field work and ethnology based on cross cultural comparison; providing an account of a particular community, society or culture
    * **Ethnology**: Examines and compares the result of ethnography, building theory to enhance our understanding of how social and cultural systems work
* **Archeological Anthropology**: Reconstructs and interprets human behaviour and cultural patterns through material remains
  * Many archeologists examine paleoecology (Look at ecosystems of the past)
  * Ecology: Study of interrelations among living things in an environment
  * Though archeologists are best known for studying prehistory, they also examine the cultures of living people
  * Helps understand religious culture from a different perspective
  * William Rathje: Garbage = Garbology, providing evidence of what people did, not what they think they did or should've done
* **Biological or Physical Anthropology**: Studies human biological diversity in time and space with 5 special interests
  * Human evolution as revealed by fossil records (Paleoanthropology)
  * Human Genetics
  * Human Growth and Development
  * Human biological plasticity (in relation to sex and gender, and how human nature is not set in stone) = the body's ability to change as it copes with stresses such as heat, cold and altitude
  * The biology, evolution, behaviour and social life of monkeys, apes and other nonhuman primates
* **Linguistic Anthropology**: Studies language in its social and cultural context, across space and over time.
