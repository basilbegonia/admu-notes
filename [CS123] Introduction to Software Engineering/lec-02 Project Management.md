# Project Management

## Planning and Estimating
* Bago ka pumasok sa guerra may baril at tatamaan ka.....
* Have a daily, weekly and monthly agenda
* The software process: accuracy of estimation increases as process proceeds
* BEP (Break Even Point): R - C = 0
  * Revenue: #units * selling price
  * Cost: numUnits * cost
  * sellingPrice * units - (FC + cost * numUnits) = 0
    * FC: Fixed Cost

## Project Management
* **Main Goal**: Finish the project on time and lower than the allocated budget [Never really happens]
* PM Factors (Must always be proportionate): Scope, Cost, Resources
* Startups everywhere because barrier to entry is cheap [especially in the tech industry]

## CPM (Critical Path Method)
  * Get task durations and dependencies [ACTIVITY : DURATION : DEPENDENCIES]
