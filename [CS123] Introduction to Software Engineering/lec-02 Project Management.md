# Project Management

## Planning and Estimating
* Bago ka pumasok sa guerra may baril at tatamaan ka.....
* Have a daily, weekly and monthly agenda
* The software process: accuracy of estimation increases as process proceeds
* BEP (Break Even Point): R - C = 0
  * Revenue: #units * selling price
  * Cost: numUnits * cost
  * sellingPrice * units - (FC + cost * numUnits) = 0
    * FC: Fixed Cost

## Project Management
* **Main Goal**: Finish the project on time and lower than the allocated budget [Never really happens]
* PM Factors (Must always be proportionate): Scope, Cost, Resources
* Startups everywhere because barrier to entry is cheap [especially in the tech industry]

## CPM (Critical Path Method)
  * Get task durations and dependencies [ACTIVITY : DURATION : DEPENDENCIES]

## Agile
* Very focused on coding
* Little to no documentation
* Simple/Elegant designs
* There's a lot of refactoring in Agile methodologies
* Iterative with a version of improvement in each iteration
* Large advantage: A new version will be finished every 3 weeks
* Stand-up meetings
  * What have you done
  * What are you working on
  * (Check the slides)

  * **Release Planning**
    * Similar to what happens during sprints, you get user stories and list them
    * Out of the list, decide on the priorities
    * eg. First release does features 1-7, then 8-10 etc
  * **Iteration**
    * Outputs to the latest version
    * Needs to run acceptance tests (many of which are integration testing)

  * Unit tests, merciless refactoring
  * Driving force: figuring out what kinds of tests needed to be worked on
